i have adapted this recipe from the joy of cooking with a few modifications that have crept in over my many years of making it. it is always a crowd pleaser and it is a breeze to prepare in the food processor. if you dont have a food processor you can easily do the chopping and mixing by hand. you can also make it a day ahead and refrigerate until you are ready to bake. a double batch will fit in a standard food processor.
