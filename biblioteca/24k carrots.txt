carrots coated with a yummy butter brown sugar and ginger sauce. i grew up eating these in texas. easy quick and yummy great way to get kids to enjoy this veggie if you like a lot of sauce double the sauce ingredients. i posted this less saucy to keep the fat and calories down. the sauce is yummy and great on rice or just on a spoon hope you enjoy it as much as we do  i am so honored that this simple little recipe of mine has been so well received. thank you all for your reviews
