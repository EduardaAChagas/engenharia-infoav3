the sponge in your bread mixing bowl put the yeast  3  4 cup water  and the cup of whole wheat flour  mix until combined then cover with plastic wrap and a towel and let it sit for 45 minutes to an hour in a warm place it should be bubbly the dough add the 2 cups water  2 cups whole wheat flour  dry milk  wheat gluten  salt  sugar and oil mix until combined heres where you learn how to make bread start to add your remaining flour i add one cup at a time but you can do it by the half a cup 2 cups might be enough but it could go up to 4 cups fully incorporate the flour you add before adding more whole wheat bread will still be a little sticky and a little stiff  carefully judge when you think you have enough once you make bread enough youll know when its enough flour you can always add more flour when youre kneading kneading by hand  20 to 30 minutes in a mixer  10 minutes i suggest the bread mixer the first time i made this i did it by hand because whole wheat is heavier i could only last about 2 minutes i baked it but this was not a light textured bread the second time i did it for 10 in my mixer wow what a difference rising once your dough is kneaded your going to coat it all over in a little oil and stick it in a bowl that will let it rise at least one and a half times its size now youre going to cover it with plastic wrap and a towel  put it in a warm place and let it rise for 45 minutes to an hour it should have risen over double its size during this rising time you want to spray or butter two bread pans i use pyrex 9x5 shaping  last rise  and baking when your dough is ready dump it out and push the bubbles out of it divide it as equal as you can flatten each piece out to a rectangle about the size of the pan then roll it up tight and pinch the seams together tucking the ends inches turn over and put in the pan seam side down put the loaves in a warm place and cover with a towel  let them rise from 30 minutes to an hour you want your loaves to be at least 2 inches over the top of the pan  nice and high  they wont rise anymore in the oven preheat your oven to 375 degrees bake for 15 minutes then lower the heat to 350 and cook for another 20 minutes they will be a deep brown take them out and remove them from their pans and cool on a cooling rack enjoy 
i hate denseheavy whole wheat bread. however i was told to keep my blood sugar level i had to eat complex carbohydrates. it began my search for a pure whole wheat bread that i could eat as a sandwich and enjoy it all. two notes the vital wheat gluten and kneading time are crucial you must do them or it wont work. also i am at a high altitude of just over 4200 feet so adjust for where you live.
