for each rub combine ingredients store in covered container and keep in dry spot can be sprinkled on meats and poultry just before cooking or several hours before remember the longer time sprinkled on  the more intense the flavor
these are great dry rubs to try before you go out and buy the whole bottle and then find out you dont like them. most of these ingredients are already in your cupboard. i keep all my old spice jars wash remove label and reuse for recipes like these. dry rubs do not need standing time but can be applied several hours in advance if kept refrigerated. the flavors become more pronounced the longer the rub is on the meat. i prefer sprinkling on and then letting sit out at room temperature for about 15 min.
