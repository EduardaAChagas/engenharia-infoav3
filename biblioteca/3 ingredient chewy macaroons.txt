preheat oven to 325 degrees line cookie sheet with parchment paper do not just grease sheet as they will stick yes  that is experience lol mix all ingredients together until well combined depending on the size you make them  either use a spoon or an ice cream scoop  and place on sheets bake for 10  12 minutes when baked  transfer to cooling racks these freeze wonderfully
these are my familys favourite macaroon. always a constant on holiday platters. i guessed at the amount because i usually combine large and small cookies when i bake.
sweetened coconut sweetened condensed milk vanilla
