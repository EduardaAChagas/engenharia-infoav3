combine the beans and onion in a glass bowl pour the oil  vinegar  sugar and celery salt into a saucepan and bring to a boil  allowing the sugar to dissolve pour the vinegar mix over the beans and onions in the bowl and mix well allow to cool for 30 minutes then refrigerate until ready to use this salad is best after about 6 hours  but is still good if you want to use it right away
this is super simple and easy to make not too vinegary and not too sweet time is less than 10 minutes to throw together
