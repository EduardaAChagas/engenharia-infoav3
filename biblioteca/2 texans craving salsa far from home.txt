in a blender  combine cilantro  tomatoes  jalapenos  juice of 1  2 a lime blend add spices and salt the salsa will have a small bite from just the jalapenos  i like to taste it now and then add in minced seeds for heat  remember to add in small amounts  jalapenos add the kind of heat that sneaks up on you not to mention one night in the fridge with all those flavors mingling could up the heat substantially sometimes i use cayenne pepper to build heat bc it dosent seem to have as strong of staying power on your tounge then again im sure others would disagree and have their own methods for building heat last add the onions and once this is done put the blender away  otherwise you end up with spicy vegetable pulp  the onions will give it texture sometimes i leave out the cilantro until i add the onions to give the sauce even more texture of course youll want to chop the leaves a little enjoy
