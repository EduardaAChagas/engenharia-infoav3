i love french rolls and love coming up with new ways to enjoy them.  this would make a great snack lunch or even a dinner with a side salad.  i had just included 12 cup sauteed mushrooms because i thought people could use their sauteed mushroom recipe of choice that added  up to that amount.  ive included what i used... not really a recipe.. just really basic but delicious.
