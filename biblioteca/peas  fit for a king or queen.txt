heat oil in large skillet over medium heat cut bacon or pancetta into small dice and cook in the oil until golden brown and fat has rendered remove the bacon to paper towels to drain cut the peeled shallots in half and slice very thin cook them in the rendered drippings until soft  along with the pepper flakes add the thawed peas and heat through distributing the shallots well add in the bacon or pancetta and toss serve the original recipe called for pancetta which now runs between 20 00 and 22 00 per lb so i used a good quality thick sliced smoked bacon with great results  
this recipe is so simple and the flavors are so amazing it was the hit at a recent dinner. everyone had to have the recipe. better double the recipe they will all want seconds
