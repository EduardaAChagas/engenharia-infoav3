salmon  first thing is to remove the salmon from the refrigerator so it can come to room temperature  or take the chill off i leave the skin on mine  or you or your seafood counter guy can remove the skin if you want i place a piece of foil on a baking sheet and spray with a non stick spray or you can spray with olive oil too place the fish on the foil and season well with salt and pepper sauce  as the salmon is coming to room temp  start the sauce in a small sauce pan on medium high heat  add the cream  honey  and mustard and whisk well to combine everything bring it to a light boil and then reduce to medium low and simmer for approximately 710 minutes make sure to stir the sauce as it comes to a light boil and once the heat is turned down  stir a couple more times the cream will naturally reduce and thicken salmon  as i mentioned  i like to broil this  but you can also bake the salmon or grill it use what method you feel most comfortable with i use the second shelf for broiling and the salmon will take anywhere from 815 minutes  depending on the thickness of the salmon serve  add the fresh dill to the mustard sauce right before serving and drizzle over the salmon enjoy 
this recipe is so very easy and quick. perfect for a weeknight dinner but also great for a dinner party. a simple cream sauce made with heavy cream mustard and honey a touch of dill and seasoned salmon. now i prefer to cook this right under the broiler but you can always use an indoor or outdoor grill or even bake it.  feel free to use what method you prefer. a foil lined baking sheet under the broiler is quick cooking and easy clean up. the sauce cooks in just a few minutes as the salmon cooks. serve this with recipe 391590 and a side salad or your favorite green vegetable. i happen to love baby peas with this.
