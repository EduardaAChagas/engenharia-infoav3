first you need some homemade chicken stock dont use store bought powder  its not hard to make  i promise you this as a former kitchen assassin turned foodlover  to make stock bring 3 l of water to a boil in a 46 l pot add the chicken frames  a good dash of salt and the bay leaves you will add more salt later but this helps to extract the maximum flavor from the chicken reduce heat to simmer for 1 hour covered  skimming occasionally do not simmer for too much longer than this or the bones start to decalcify and make the stock bitter flavoured in the meantime clean and rough chop 2 5 kg of potatos  set aside clean and rough chop 1 large leek  set aside youre going to puree it all once its nice and soft from cooking so dont obsess over getting perfect  small diced cubes you just want it chopped up enough so that theyll cook out nicely in the pot back to the stock your hour of simmering is done and voila  you have stock  now remove the chicken frames  set aside strain the stock so that you catch any fine bones that may have come loose while simmering add the leek add the potato boil till soft once the chicken frames are cool to a temperature you can handle them  chip whatever meat there is off set the meat aside pluck out the bay leaves whiz soup till smooth we use a bar mixer personally return chicken meat to pot add salt and pepper to taste  for those who arent familiar  this means add a bit  stir it well  let the flavors mingle for a minute or two  spoon a bit out and taste to tell if it suits your preferences dont be afraid of the salt  one of the basic tenants of cheffing is that salt equals flavor soup is now ready to eat but if you prefer a thicker soup  allow to simmer uncovered to reduce  till its as thick as you like
this started out life as just leek and potato soup one of a plethora of soups in my husbands box of cheffy tricks.  when i saw him about to just chuck the chicken frames into the bin after having made the stock i protested and told him to chip off the meat and put it back in the soup.  he was a bit dubious but has now changed the recipe to include chicken
chicken carcasses salt bay leaves potatoes leek pepper
