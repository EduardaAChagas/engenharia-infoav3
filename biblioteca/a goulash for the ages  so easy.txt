brown ground beef and strain add both cans of soup add the rest of the ingredients to the soup and ground beef let it heat up thoroughly serve over macaroni noodles
i adopted this goulash from my boyfriends father. i havent seen anybody else cook it this way. i dont measure any of the ingredients when i cook it so unfortunately the measurements here are not exact. just keep adding more of the ingredients until you get the taste you want. it is a sweet goulash but the mustard and the vinegar give it a little bite you could add canned tomatoes or onion to it but i like bare bones. very easy to make.
