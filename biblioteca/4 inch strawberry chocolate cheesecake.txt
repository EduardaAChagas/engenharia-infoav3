cooking time includes chilling overnight and setting time for the topping. i adjusted several cheesecake recipes to be used with a 4 or 4 12 inch springform cheesecake pan. these small cheesecakes are great for those who cannot finish off a large cheesecake or who want a treat but dont want to tempt themselves to go overboard. if you want to make enough for a 9 inch pan multiply this recipe by 4.
