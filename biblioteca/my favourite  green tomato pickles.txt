its quite difficult to find green tomatoes at the local outdoor markets so when i do find them in quantity i make these pickles. they will keep it seems forever. they are really tasty but a bit timeconsuming to make however they are really worth it. i hope whoever tries them enjoys them as much as i do. they are great with veal or pork cutlets.please note that i do not use a hot water bath. i sterilize my jars by washing them well and letting them sit in boiling water for a few minutes. i then put them in a 200 degree oven for perhaps an hour. the lids and seals i gently boil for about five minutes. the hot jars are packed and the lids are twisted finger tight and left to cool on a folded bath towel. lids go pop when seal is completed. an extremely simple way to sterilize jars and ensure the safety of your finished product.
