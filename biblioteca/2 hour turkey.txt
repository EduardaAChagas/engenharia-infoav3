cut off skin at the neck cut off wing and second joint remove giblets clean turkey and pat dry salt and pepper inside and out coat all over with oil  rubbing in a little to make sure you have a good coating sprinkle generously with paprika place turkey on its side in a large roaster roast in a 400 degree oven for 23 hours 3  4 of the way through the cooking time  turn turkey to the other side it is very important that you do not pierce the skin just a hint to ensure you dont pierce the skin and let out all the juice you might want to use a couple old oven mitts and just pick up the bird to flip it
