note ive attempted to fix the ingredients section of the recipe and its a food.com issue not mine. please refer to the individual recipes listed in the directions section if choosing to make these packets theres no right way to enjoy a sausage but if you want a little direction the cohosts from the chew show you their favorite toppings and combinations. when michael made these packets on the chew his drizzled olive oil on all the packets. this came from the chew.
