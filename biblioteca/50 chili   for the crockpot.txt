combine all ingredients in a 7quart crockpot it might be easier to combine in a larger vessel  mix  and then transfer to your crockpot cook on high for 5 hours  or low for 8 hours i typically serve the chili over a bed of whole tostito chips  with a layer of shredded cheese in between
first thank you to parsley  chef  199848  for inspiring me with her thick and chunky crock pot game day chili recipe 251837.  i had tried about 20 different recipes for chili and parsleys was the best.  but ive been tweaking it for a year and a half now and i think i did it  this chili is medium to mediumhot not very sweet hearty and stewlike with depth and a delicious aftertaste.  i make in a 7quart crockpot for my large family.  if you like your chili sweeter use a red onion instead of a white onion add more brown sugar andor add more chocolate chips.  be careful  a little chocolate  just like cumin and cinnamon  goes a looonnnngggg way
