an easy and very light christmas pudding  for those that dislike the heavy dark puddings. however this still has all the traditional christmas pudding ingredients but it is served with a delicious butterscotch sauce for a decadent twist moreover all the family can now have their pudding and eat it as this appeals to all ages steaming a pudding is so easy  you just pop it on to gently steam whilst you prepare the rest of the festive meal. you only have to remember to keep topping up the water from time to time. serve warm with the hot butterscotch sauce and maybe a jug of single cream or brandy custard to help it along merry christmas n.b. this recipe was taken from the christmas 2003 edition of bbc good food magazine i have amended it slightly to personal taste. i have made this pudding every year since i first saw the recipe and i have given this recipe out countless times
