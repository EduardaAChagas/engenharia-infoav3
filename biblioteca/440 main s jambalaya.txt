i have the paula deen version of jambalaya posted but this one i have had the pleasure of eating at 440 main a very ritzy restaurant where i went to college.  its fancy and a bit on the expensive side but well worth the money.  when i took my gourmet cooking class the teacher called the restaurant and got the recipe for us to make in class.  i was so happy  this recipe is quick cooking the prep takes a bit though.
chicken breasts shrimp vegetable oil red pepper green pepper celery onion andouille sausages ham chicken stock tomato sauce salt shrimp boil seasoning cooked longgrain rice parsley
