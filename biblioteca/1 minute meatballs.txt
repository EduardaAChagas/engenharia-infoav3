remove skin from sausages cut into 11 1  2 pieces add oil  if using  and fry sausage until brown and no longer pink drain on paper towel and use in your favorite recipe
this is a real short cut for cooks in a hurry. use the cooked sausage bits like you would any meatball. in soups stews spaghetti casseroles or as an appetizer with a sauce. cheating not really just using a good shortcut.
