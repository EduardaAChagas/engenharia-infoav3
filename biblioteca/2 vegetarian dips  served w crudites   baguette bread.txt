on our 2nd wedding anniversary 2 yrs ago dh took me to a restaurant 1 hr outside of reykjavik that specialized in lobster  a lovely view of the sunset over the atlantic ocean. we ate just 2 things  their lobster bisque  a pan filled wsml lobster tails steamed in herbed garlic butter. but they served both wassorted pesto  tapenade spreads to spread on baguette slices that were tdf wonderful. since then i have been fascinated wthat genre  then i found these recipes in the almost vegetarian cookbook of the australian womens weekly cookbook series. since i now have lobster in my freezer i wanted to preserve these recipes for spec occasions here at home. enjoy
