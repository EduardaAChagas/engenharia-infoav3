roll ground beef into very small balls  just a touch bigger than the peas brown on medium heat in nonstick pan sprayed lightly with oil keep them moving while browning add rest of ingredients  slowly stirring until all is well incorporated serve over rice  pasta or toast points and thats all there is  folks 
way back when....i use to get 15.00 a week to feed two adults one toddler and a infant. i use to get one lbs of ground beef cut it into quarters and make four meals. back then i called it dr. martins mix in honor of the dr. to whom we owed so much money. the amount of servings really depend on who you are serving adults or children.
