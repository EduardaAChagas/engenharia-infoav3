boil shrimp just until pink drain and set aside bottom layer mix all ingredients and spread in shallow serving dish i use a round one with a flat bottom and shallow sides second layer spread chili sauce over bottom layer third layer press cucumber between paper towels to remove all excess moisture sprinkle cucumbers and onions over chili sauce layer fourth layer sprinkle shrimp over veggies finally  sprinkle cheese and jalapeno peppers on top cover with plastic wrap and chill serve with crackers and a spreading knife
this makes a pretty presentation at a cocktail party and everyone loves it. definitely best if made with fresh shrimp or crab. for overnight ballgame trips i often take each layer prepared in separate bags or plastic containers and assemble the morning before the football games.
