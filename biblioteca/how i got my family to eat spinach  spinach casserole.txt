if spinach scares you this is one recipe that contains spinach that you do not have to be afraid of it is so delicious that even my picky kids like it. my motherinlaw makes this for gettogethers and she passed the recipe on to me. you can also use broccoli instead of the spinach which she does often but i have never tried...it is great the way it is she also eats this hot or cold but i only like it hot  enjoy
