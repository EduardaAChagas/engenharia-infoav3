my icelandic hubby loves deviled eggs ... especially this version. leftovers are required as he likes the baconegg flavors with his breakfast cereal  coffee. i went through a lot of devilled egg recipes posted here to be sure it wasnt a duplicate  got some new ideas to try for him but im sure this will stay his favorite. as the ingredients  name imply the recipe takes the loaded baked potato approach to devilled eggs.
