preheat oven to 350 degrees f combine the first 5 ingredients in a large mixing bowl stir until blended in another bowl combine all of the remaining ingredients slowly add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture stirring until well blended cover cookie sheets with aluminum foil  and lightly grease with a nonstick cooking spray drop small spoonfuls of dough onto the sheet and bake for 1015 minutes allow to cool i love to refrigerate these cookies and serve them cold  but im sure they would taste great at room temperature as well
these cookies are absolutely delicious and practically guilt free only about 35 calories per cookie they are so tasty and soft you would never guess how healthy they really are. great dessert or snack for the fall and winter seasons. i have a few in my fridge all year long to keep me from snacking on more sinful temptations...
