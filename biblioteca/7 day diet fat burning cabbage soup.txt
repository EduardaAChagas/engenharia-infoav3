original diet cabbage soup is posted here recipe 281160 but i wanted it organic with no added soup mix or canned vegetables. this diet is derived from one given at the sacred heart memorial hospital for overweight heart patients to lose weight rapidly usually before surgery. and by ed kasper l.ac acupuncturist and herbalist.  which i tweaked to my likings. yes you can tweak to your likings as well. vegetarians can use aduki or mung beans seitan where called for. this is a shortterm fix mostly water weight. a good seasonal cleanse or a way to start jump a diet.
