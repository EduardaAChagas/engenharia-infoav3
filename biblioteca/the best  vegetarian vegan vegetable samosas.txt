modified from madhur jaffreys worldoftheeast vegetarian cookingthese are delicious the effort of making your own samosa crust instead of buying phyllo dough is well worth it. samosas may be served at room temperature or they may be served warm. samosas may be made ahead of time up to a day refrigerated neatly in flat plastic containers and then reheated in a 350 degree oven. if you wish to freeze samosas fry them partially drain them and freeze them in a single layer in flat plastic containers. when you wish to eat them defrost and fry them a second time.
