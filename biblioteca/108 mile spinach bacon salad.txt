this is a great salad from an excellent restaurant or it was the last time i was there. this salad makes an excellent lunch. add a crusty roll for a light summer supper. the dressing is excellent. i posted the cook time as 0 but of course you have to cook the eggs and the bacon drain the fat and allow time for both to cool. the 4 servings are main course servings. if using this as a side salad it will serve 810.
