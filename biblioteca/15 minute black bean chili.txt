brown meat in a pot over medium heat while the meat is browning drain and rinse the beans add corn kernels and cook for 2 minutes more stir in beans  tomatoes  and taco seasoning simmer for 5 to 10 minutes
this is very similar to the one i used to make as a vegetarian but i had a small amount of meat to use up so i tried this. again its also good as a burrito filling and topped with whatever you normally like on your chili. i use reduced fat cheddar cheese or maybe sour cream.
