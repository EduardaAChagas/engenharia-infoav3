place white grape juice and gingerale in refrigerator overnight or until well chilled placing them in the freezer for a couple of hours before serving will make them icy and everyones favorite in a serving picture or punch bowl  pour equal parts white grape juice and gingerale stir gently fill each glass  and if you want garnish with frozen fruit optional garnish on a lined cookie sheet  place the fruit in a single layer but not touching  into the freezer for several hours until frozen after they are completely frozen  they can be bagged together as long as they stay in the freezer so they dont stick together then use one of each fruit to garnish each glass it is beautiful and also keeps it colder longer and doesnt water down the flavor
ive been making this punch for years.  i wish i had a dollar for every time someone asks for the receipe and then thinks that im truly keeping it a secret because they cant believe it only has 2 ingredients.  it is the easiest most light and refreshing compliment to any shower tea or party gathering.  its beautiful looking too and matches any theme or color.  you can make it for a few people up to 100s and still it is a money friendly punch because it has only 2 ingredients.  but dont let the only 2 ingredients fool you.  its delicious  some people say it reminds them of champagne.  kid friendly teen friendly adult friendly.   enjoy
