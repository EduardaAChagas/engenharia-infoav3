yes  10 lbs i stuff the bird and use the rest as a separate casserole it all gets eaten bake potatoes when done and cool enough grate them and put into large bowl i use skin and all add butter and mix do not use margerine add other ingredients and mix well add salt to taste stuff turkey or chicken and roast according to your instructions for the rest of it butter a casserole dish and put in remaining stuffing bake in oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes baste periodically with turkey  chicken drippings and cook until it has a nice crust on top if you want a vegetarian dish use a rich vegetable broth to baste it with
family legend has it that this originated with the danish royal family.  apparently my mothers friend knew the cook.  it is by far my favorite stuffing and of course we stuff chickens etc. with it and even make it as a vegan casserole by leaving out the poultry all together.  i have modified it somewhat over the years but it is still basically the same recipe.
potatoes onions celery breadcrumbs butter ground sage salt fresh ground pepper poultry drippings
