it just doesnt get much easier than this foolproof rice sidedish.  it wont look like much when it goes in the oven but trust me it comes out perfect every time.  ive been making it for holiday dinners for years.  it takes 5 minutes or less to throw together and can go in the oven with those other last minute dishes or prepare it ahead and reheat in the microwave at serving time if oven space is a problem.  note  the original recipe called for 12 cup butter but i found that to be excessive.
