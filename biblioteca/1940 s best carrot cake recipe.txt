from jane at just a pinch recipe club again going back to my vintage recipes that have been in my family for years i spotted an old recipe from the 40s for carrot cake. it was titled the best carrot cake. well i figured it was now the 90s at the time and was sure someone probably had come up with a better recipe since then. i was wrong. to date i have not tasted better carrot cake ever. its easy and the outcome is amazing.
