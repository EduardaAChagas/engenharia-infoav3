in large mixing bowl  combine refried beans and salsa consistency should be that of cake frostingspreadable but not thick adjust amount of salsa accordingly spread bean and salsa mixture onto serving platter layer remaining ingredients serve with baked tostitos scoops tortilla chips even my greenveggiephobic children devour this dish  this recipe is moderately spicy change the heat of the salsa to adjust you could also top with jalapenos or other hot peppers to add more heat i sometimes use different greens instead of iceberg lettuce and use different cheeses
