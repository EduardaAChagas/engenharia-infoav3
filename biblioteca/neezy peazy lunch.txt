fry the onion with the olive oil in a saucepan until they are soft add the frozen peas and carrots add the water  but dont cover the vegetables with it  as the steam will also cook the vegetables cook on a medium heat  stirring now and again  until the vegetables have softened keep an eye on the water level add the diced tomatoes salt and pepper to season bring to the boil and then simmer for about 5 minutes serve with basmati rice
this is a great meal eaten the same day but even better the next day  if you can wait add your favourite spices but try it first as it is and i think that you will enjoy the vegetable taste. good for freezing.
