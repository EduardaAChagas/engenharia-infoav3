this is my personal never before published version of the famous dicks burnt almond cake from dicks bakery in san jose ca. i was not as impressed as some by the original i did however taste potential. after several months of testing this is the finished product. i am told that my version is better than dicks. ill let you judge for yourselves. the procedure can appear a bit daunting but trust me its not. just read the recipe from beginning to end and then take it one section at a time and you will be justly rewarded
