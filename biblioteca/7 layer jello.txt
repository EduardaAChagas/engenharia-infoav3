very good  can change jello flavors to any flavor or color you want.  my mom makes this for get togethers and always get rave reviews. use can use red and green for christmas and so on.  from thank heaven for home made cooks cookbook. use a 9 x 13 dish.  preferably glass because this is such a beautiful looking salad.  careful when adding the layers.  start out spooning it on and then tip pan and pour out over spoon as not to mix the layers.  worth the wait.  can use sugarfree jello fat free evaporated milk and lite cool whip.
