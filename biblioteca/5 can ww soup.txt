put all the above ingredients into crockpot leave on low for 4 hours or more or you can put all ingredients in one pot on stove and bring to a slight boil  then reduce heat to simmer and cook for about 15 to 20 minute i prefer the crockpot  so the flavors simmer  and i can eat this for a snack when i am waiting for my next meal  and feel very hungry
this is easy yummy and is only 5 points for the entire pot there is another recipe posted for this but this is entirely different. im sure there are other combinations but i like this because you know me quantity. not sure on the servings because i dont count them. del monte fresh cut is what i use. this also can be made in crock pot.
