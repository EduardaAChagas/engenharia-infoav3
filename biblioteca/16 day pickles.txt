my mother got this from her sister martha. its a tried and true pickle recipe. its very similar to recipe 17490 on recipezaar. sometimes i dont always have 2 gallons of cumcumbers but will make if i have gathered enough for 1 gallon but i go ahead and make the syrup and save it and use it on the next batch. since the syrup has vinegar and sugar in it it will be alright and i dont even refrigerate this syrup.
