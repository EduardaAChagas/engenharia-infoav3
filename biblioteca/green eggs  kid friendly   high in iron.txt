my daughter and i are both anemic and were looking for easy and yummy ways to incorporate more iron into our diet. ill admit they dont look really appetizing but these eggs are light and fluffy and are great accompanied by dr. seuss green eggs and ham.  my daughter is 2 and can be picky so i was ecstatic that she loved these eggs and asks for them almost daily. mustard greens are an amazing source of vitamins and nutrients
