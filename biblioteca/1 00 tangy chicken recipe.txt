this is one of our all time favorite chicken bbq recipes. the recipe produces a spicy moist flavorful bbq chicken. you might say its one of our signature bbq recipes. the idea for the chicken came out of a bargain bin. the store was selling 3 cookbooks for a dollar and naturally i couldnt pass that up. i found a bbq recipe that had possibilities. since we like spicy food we jazzed it up a bit and we got a great bbq chicken. prep time includes marinating time.
