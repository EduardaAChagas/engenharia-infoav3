when life was simpler and few people traveled beyond their own community the use of a single ingredient could imply an exotic flare. if a dish had pineapple in it it would be called hawaiian if it had a green pepper added then it was spanish or mexican. this dish comes from those simpler less global village times. its from a 1949 better homes and gardens cookbook and was my all time favourite dish when i was growing up on the farm. i even requested it as my birthday meal thats how much i loved it  very basic comfort food not meant to compete with todays hotter foods or a gourmet palate. this recipe is now officially 60 years old and just as comforting and filling as it was when i was a child. and lastly 60 years ago this type of meal was called dininginadish.
