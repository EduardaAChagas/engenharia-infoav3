dressing combine first 11 ingredients and let rest for a day before making salad to allow flavors to blend salad combine lettuce  tomatoes and red onions just before serving add eggs  salad crunchy mix  top with bacon and tortilla strips serve immediately
this dressing was first brought to my attention by my sil who found it in a local fund raisingawareness cookbook called breast of friend.  this cookbook has been researched tried and put together by volunteers in foam lake saskatchewan canada.  the salad i use most frequently is not the one in the cookbook but one i have put together.  the dressing gets better as it sits. prep time does not include the time the dressing sits. note do not have to make my lettuce salad try it on your own favorite lettuce salad.  i add 34 cup of salad crunchy mix found at nutters it is a combination of toasted sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds soybeans and sesame seeds.
