preheat the oven to 325 degrees f toss the chocolate and butter into a small bowl and set over a small pot of simmering water to begin melting it this will insulate the delicate chocolate from direct heat and keep it from scorching as they begin to melt stir until smooth then remove them from the heat whisk the eggs  sugar  vanilla and coffee together add the chocolate mixture  whisk until smooth then divide evenly between four coffee mugs place the mugs in a small highsided pot add enough hot water around the cups to equal the level of the batter within the cups bake until the custards are set  about 45 minutes check their doneness by jiggling them slightly they should appear to be set but still have a bit of a quiver in the center you may also insert a toothpick to judge doneness they may take as long as 60 minutes but no longer
michael smith says im addicted to chocolate and always look for a way to work it into a treat especially with coffee. together they make mocha. this coffee flavoured chocolate cake batter baked in coffee cups looks like a cup of coffee  until you cut into it. enjoy
