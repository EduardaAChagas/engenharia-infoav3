arrange 4 ice cream sandwiches long sides touching on a serving plate squirt an even layer of whipped cream over top scatter with 1  3 cup chopped oreos or malted milk balls repeat layers 2 times  garnishing top with a few larger chunks of oreos or malted milk balls freeze 6 hours or until firm slice to serve may be frozen for up to a week
this makes a delicious dessert that looks great i saw it in womans day magazine and they called for using whoppers candy but i used oreos in mine. cook time is for the 6 hour freeze time but it may not take the full 6 hours for the cake to freeze firmly.
