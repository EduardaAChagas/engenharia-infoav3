i had some leftover mexican roast beef and didnt really know what to do with it.  i threw a bunch of stuff into a pan and simmered it for awhile.  the mixture tasted wonderful  i had thought to make tacos but then i got lazy so i made it into a layered casserole instead.  this is a very friendly versatile recipe as you can use leftover beef roast or pork roast and vary your ingredients and spices to suite your tastes.  also i like to make the casserole up in the morning then toss it into the oven just before dinner time.  makes a hectic time just a little easier.  note  you can make a mexican roast by cooking a roast in the crockpot with salsa.
