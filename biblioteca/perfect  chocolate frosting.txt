place a large bowl  filled halfway with ice  in the sink in a medium size pot over medium low heat  melt chocolate  cream  and butter stirring constantly  cook the mixture until all of the butter and chocolate melts and thickens cook for 56 minutes do not let boil remove pot from heat whisk in the sifted confectioners sugar until mixture becomes smooth  then put the pot on top of the bowl of ice beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 45 minutes until frosting becomes smooth  thick  and fudgy remove from ice spread onto cooled cake layers the frosting will thicken as it sets up if the frosting gets too hard to spread  put back on low heat and stir constantly until you get the spreading consistency desired i have been adding 1 tbs of light corn syrup to the initial heavy cream and chocolate mixture to add more glossiness to the frosting
this is now one of my favorite chocolate frostings. i got it from the chocolate cake mix doctor by anne byrn. i have made a few changes to the recipe. actually i didnt have the 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips that the original recipe called for. lennie came to the rescue thanks by figuring out the appropriate amount of semisweet squares to use which i did have on hand. now i always make it with the squares instead of the chips. this frosting is very thick creamy and fudgy. i usually bake two 9inch layers cut them into four layers and slather this frosting on each and every layer and all over the top and sidesbecause i like a little cake with my frosting  another thanks goes out to leeannr for making me post this recipe. now she loves it as much as i do.
