im very picky about my chili as i get terrible heartburn.  this is how my momalways made it and its the only way ill eat it.  its one of my favoritethings to make in the colder months.yes there is a story behind the name.  my best friend lived right next door tome for a year and was always more than happy to eat dinner with us.  one nightshe was over and i made this chili.  after wolfing down the entire bowl she saidto me you can never let my boyfriend have this ever  when i asked why sheresponded he would definetly leave me for you.   hope you all love it asmuch as we do.
