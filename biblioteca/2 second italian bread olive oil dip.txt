whisk the two together with a fork  dip your bread in  and enjoy
know how at some italian restaurants they give you the option of both butter and a dish with herbed olive when they bring out the bread i found that i actually prefer the olive oil dip to butter in terms of both taste and ease to use i dont have to wait for olive oil to melt plus olive oil is monounsaturated fat thats better for you while butter is saturated fat that isnt. i use recipe 391627 feel free to use another mix or storebought seasoning tastes just like the kind in restaurants to enjoy with focaccia or crusty italian bread.
