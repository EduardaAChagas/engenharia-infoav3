in a large skillet brown the first 5 ingredients together until meat is donedo not drain add the remaining ingredients to the skillet  mix well and simmer on low until done  around 30 minutes you may need to add quite a bit of water if the casserole is drying out  depending on the barley used  and the altitude you live at
very simple and easy to make. spice it up if you wish or leave as is and you can omit the meat and use chopped mushrooms.
