combine first four ingredients for the dressing in a container and shake well put the lettuce in a bowl  sprinkle with bacon  blue cheese and red onion rings drizzle enough of the dressing to coat or to taste along with freshly ground pepper and enjoy
there was a chain of italian restaurants in the columbus ohio area that had this awesome salad as their house salad.  i dont like blue cheese so asked for it to be omitted but loved the combination of bacon lettuce and dressing.  when the salad was brought to the table they then offered fresh ground black pepper.  i think this recipe was posted in the columbus dispatch newspaper.  note  due to this being a restaurant recipe it makes a alot of dressing about two cups so you might want to cut the amount of dressing to 14 or 12 of this recipe.
vegetable oil white vinegar sugar garlic powder lettuce bacon blue cheese red onion
