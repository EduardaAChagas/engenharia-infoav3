mix the dry spices together wash and cut the cucumber and put the slices into the bowl dont pat them dry or anything leave them wet so it can pick up the seasoning pour the seasoning mix onto the cucumber slices and toss around in the bowl so they each get plenty of the mix theyre ready to eat  about 2 generouslysized servings that are great for a lunch or snack side dish
after enjoying recipe 230631 the other day i decided to jazz up some cucumbers instead of making the sandwiches by using the same spices i used. feel free to use chopped fresh mint leaves i prefer the taste and texture of dried mint.
cucumber dried mint kosher salt ground black pepper
