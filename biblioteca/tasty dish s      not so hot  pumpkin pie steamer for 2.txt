on low or mediumlow heat  warm the milk  honey and pumpkin pie spice or english mixed spice on the stove for a few minutes  stirring to melt the honey completely warning   if preparing for children  dont heat the milk too hot or it will burn their mouths  remove pan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract carefully transfer the liquid to a blender and blend on high speed for at least a full minute or until the milk is light and frothy you could also use a stick  immersion blender to froth the milk  if you prefer however yet another warning make sure your pot is deep enough or the hot milk will splatter pour into two fancy tea cups and garnish each with a small cinnamon stick and a light sprinkle of nutmeg tasty likes to use her whole cinnamon stick as a straw 
tasty dish last week requested  a pumpkin steamer and i quickly threw this together. success yay note this recipe will also work with rice milk soy almond milk etc. if you want to go the dairyfree route. skip the honey for a vegan version and use another alternate sugar. happy thanksgiving
