wisk all ingredients except olive oil then slowly drizzle olive oil in while whisking quickly to incorporate the oil we sometimes put it all into a jar and shake it very well until blended  then refrigerate until needed its recommended to let it sit a few hours  but it can be used right away to store  pour into an airtight jar and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week you can also freeze it for up to 2 months or use a canning method to store for up to 1 year
this sauce is packed with pizza flavor and requires no cooking done in 2 minutes although its recommended to let sit for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld.
