for many new englanders independence day celebrations just wouldnt be the same without the traditional meal of poached salmon with egg sauce along with new potatoes baby peas and of course strawberry shortcake recipe 289569.  the egg sauce is a nice compliment to most any baked or broiled fish as well as the poached salmon. just substitute a half a cup of bottled clam juice or canned chicken broth for the poaching liquid.
