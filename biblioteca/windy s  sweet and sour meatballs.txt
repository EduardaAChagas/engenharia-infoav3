whenever we had a potluck lunch at the office or a neighborhood bbq i would make these the night before tripling the recipe then plug in the crock pot to heat them up for whichever event was going on. they always went quickly. i think they are very good and are really easy to make. if you are making this for a family meal they are really nice served with rice. if you are making it for a crowd just put out a bunch of toothpicks and let folks help themselves.
