a quick very easy low clean up way to make enchiladas.  i adapted this from a few other recipes.  we prefer flour tortillas but you can use corn.  corn does work better if they are warm so putting them in the microwave for 3040 seconds makes them more pliable.  you can always substitute fresh cooked ground beef turkey or chicken for the canned meat.
