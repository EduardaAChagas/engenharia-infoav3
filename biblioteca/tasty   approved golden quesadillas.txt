keep trying  in a small bowl  grate cheese and set aside heat a nonstick pan over mediumhigh heat until it becomes very warm to the touch sprinkle the shredded cheese of choice onto the surface of the pan  spreading out the cheese to the approximate diameter of the tortilla when the cheese starts to melt  lay the tortilla on top of the cheese and press it down into the melting cheese let the tortilla sit  undisturbed  in the pan for approximately 30 seconds gently test around the edges by sliding a wide spatula under the tortilla lift tortilla slightly to check if the cheese has turned golden and is sticking to the tortilla once the cheese has stuck  slide the spatula completely under the tortilla and flip it over to brown the other side slide tortilla onto a platter if desired  top with your favorite quesadilla fillings like guacamole  shredded lettuce  salsa  black olives  sour cream  etc
you know when cheese has gone from that melted stage to that yummy golden crusty stage for this quesadilla recipe you can use mild medium or sharp cheese monterey jack parmesan etc. corn tortillas can be used in place of the flour tortillas if you wish.feliz cumpleanos td local recipe.
