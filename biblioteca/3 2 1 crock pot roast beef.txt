mix the broth  soup mix and the pepsi in the crock pot and stir to mix add the roast and cook on low for  57 hours turn occasionally this is the basic recipe i usually add crushed garlic and chopped onions if you leave the roast for 7 hours  you will get a pulled beef  just shred it with a fork  awesome on buns you can also remove the roast after 3 hours and slice the roast and then return the slices to the crock pot for 3 more hours  roast beef fit for company
