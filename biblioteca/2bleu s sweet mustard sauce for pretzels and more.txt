mix all ingredients together chill covered in fridge at least 1 hour
this is a wonderful dip for pretzels that is also great on burgers salads hot dogs etc. the possibilities are endless and it will keep about two months in the refrigerator. try it with recipe 252656 or recipe 295738 note based on reviews and myself trying it i have edited out the oil in the ingredient list. it works great without it. reviews are great as they really do help us to be better cooks and recipe developers.
