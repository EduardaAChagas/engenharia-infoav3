put the ingredients into the bread machine pan in the order listed select the whole wheat bread cycle remove from the pan when its done and let cool for 15 minutes before slicing during the summer i reduce the yeast to 1 tsp because it seems to rise so much more during the summer than the winter or you could increase the salt slightly so if youre getting a really huge loaf try one of these 2 things and it should be better for you for some reason atmospheric pressure makes a difference in how a bread rises enjoy  thanks for all your great reviews  another thing ive been doing to make this even healthier is adding 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed with the flour it doesnt really change the flavour but adds some good for you omega 3s 
this is our everyday lunch bread. i make it every night for the next day. i originally got it from the oster bread machine recipe book but i adapted it somewhat. the 100 whole wheat recipe was just too heavy for our family. it makes a 2 lb loaf. once i started making this bread i couldnt go back to store bought
