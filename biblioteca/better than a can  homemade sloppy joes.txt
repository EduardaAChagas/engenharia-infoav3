ive had this recipe for many years and i used to make it on a regular basis when i was a newlywed and made it often for the kids when they were itty bitty. it is a great recipe and one well worth making from scratch.  due to a crazy work and life schedule i weened off of making it but im placing it back on my repertoire.  i originally got this recipe from an old foodnetwork show called chef dujour where a different chef was featured daily.  this particular day lauren groveman was the chef who presented this recipe.
