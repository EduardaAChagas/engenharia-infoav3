start by making the cake preheat the oven to 350 degrees lightly grease the bottom of 9 round pans set butter out on counter so it can soften at room temperature  salt for cake and filling put a metal bowl in the freezer to chill so it will be ready when you make the mousse sift flours together add cocoa  xanthan gum  baking soda  cream of tarter and salt in a separate large bowl  beat the butter until creamy slowly add the brown sugar and granulated white sugar  whip until fluffy add the eggs and egg yolks one at a time to the butter sugar mixture then add the vanilla turn the mixer to low and alternately add the flour mixture and coconut milk to the butter  egg  sugar mixture pour equal amounts of the mixture into the prepared pans bake for 3035 minutes until the cake is springy to the touch and a tooth pick comes out clean set on cooling racks to cool let the cakes cool completely before attempting to stack if you would like a smooth edge you can trim the cakes to be the same size prior to adding chocolate mousse layers while the cake is baking  prepare the mousse filling  frosting  cut the butter into small cubes in a small microwaveable bowl  combine the chocolate chips and butter melt in the microwave for 2030 seconds at a time until smooth be careful not to boil he chocolate as it will change the consistency of the mousse and make a huge mess in the microwave add vanilla and 1  2 cup of heavy whipping cream to the chocolate  butter mixture until combine remove metal bowl from freezer  combine chocolate  butter mixture and remaining heavy whipping cream using a hand mixer whip until smooth and firm peaks begin to form do not over whip as the mousse will break and have a graining appearance cover mousse with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until ready to use putting the cake together put a small amount of mousse and spread it in the center of the pan or plate you are making the cake on  this will keep it from moving while you frost it place the first layer of cake on top of the mousse  cover the top of the cake with mousse mixture repeat by stacking the next layer on top of the mousse using a cake knife or smooth spatula  cover the outside of the cake with mousse using a decorating bag filled with remaining mousse mixture  decorate the edges and top of the cake if the mousse starts to melt or if your work space is warm  you may need to move mousse back to the refrigerator between layers to prevent it from melting you can also use shredded coconut  chocolate chips  or chocolate shavings if you prefer for decoration refrigerate until ready to serve and left overs i refrigerated mine over night before serving and it was still delicious and moist for 34 days after cutting
this is a modification to gluten free chocolate cake httpwww.food.comrecipeglutenfreechocolatecake224448 previously posted. i added a layer to make it big adjusted ingredients to be more allergy friendly and made a chocolate mousse filling between the layers. the mousse filling doubles as frosting without making it too sweet. i hope you love it.
