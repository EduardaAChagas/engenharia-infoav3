another golden oldie from a recipe card originally from a 1905 blue ribbon cook book. any fruit is good but some tart fruit is necessary. you can add cherries or seedless grapes if you like. it is a great allyearround recipe with fruits that are usually readily available. if fresh pineapple is not available use canned sliced pineapple or canned pineapple chunks. add the banana and the apple just before serving to prevent browning.
