boil potatoes until tender but not mushy  set aside to cool for dressing mix all ingredients in a bowl any and all of the ingredients can be adjusted to your taste as my dressing never turns out the same way twice depending on whether im in the mood for sweet  peppery  salty  etc mix potatoes  celery  onion  egg  and dressing in a bowl and chill enjoy 
i have had people who swear they hate miracle whip eat an entire plate of this potato salad.  its my moms recipe and you can try it with regular mayo but i wont stand by the results because its so good with the whip that ive never tried it any other way
