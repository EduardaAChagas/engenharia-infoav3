combine dry ingredients in a large microwaveable mug stir in the egg add oil  vanilla extract and milk and mix well taking care to ensure any dry ingredients arent sticking to the sides and bottom of the mug microwave on medium  high for 3 minutes allow to cool and then enjoy on its own or with a bit of whipped cream or ice cream 
i think this recipe is good for satisfying a chocolate browniecake craving. its cheaper than buying a baked good and since it only makes one or two servings its economical as well not having to make a large cake just to satisfy a oneday craving.the cake comes out a bit dense. texturaly more closer to a light brownie than a cake.i used a 6 tall tapered mug it expanded the full height whilst cooking but shrunk down to 4 once the cooking process was done. the cake really shrinks away from the sides of the mug so itll fall out easily.i made this without adding any chocolate chips and dont think its too chocolatey as is but chocolatey enough.
