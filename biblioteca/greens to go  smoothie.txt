this is from nancy campbell from above rubies magazine.  the chlorophyll in greens combats tumor growth it works on the adrenal glands purifies the lymph nodes unclogs the arteries and enriches the blood. it protects against radiation. chlorophyll is only one of the many benefits of greens. it also provides a large gamut of vitamins and minerals phytonutrients and colon cleansing cellulose. it is blended so smoothly that even babies starting solids and toddlers who cant chew up greens can swallow these power foods and not gag. the cellulose is broken down and the greens are so easily digested that they begin to assimilate even while still in their mouth.  you might need to play with the greens amount to get the right amount of sweetness.  i added more fruit to cut the greens taste and would use only milk or kefir instead of water next time.  try strawberry raspberry peach etc.  i adjusted it just a bit.
