saw this in a 2009 issue of family circle.  i tweaked it a bit to suit our taste and dh was very happy with the results.  its really easy to make and is ready in no time. the capicola gives it quite a bit of a kickthats why ive tagged it spicyso i would go easy on the pepper until you taste test.   if you you try it i hope you enjoy it.
