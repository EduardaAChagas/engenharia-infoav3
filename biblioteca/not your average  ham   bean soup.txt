place ham bone  onion  celery  carrots and water in a large stock pot bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer  skimming foam occasionally when meat is starting to separate from the bone  remove bone and allow to cool add bouillon  i used ham flavored better than bouillon  garlic salt and pepper add beans  whatever kind you like  tomatoes and continue to simmer remove ham from bone and return ham to soup mixture along with cubed ham at this point i recommend you taste test the soup for seasonings  but be careful  it doesnt bite your tongue  it grabs your throat  i served this with corn bread and fresh fried potatoes with bacon  onion it gets better after a day or two in the refrigerator
at one time i was making cowboy caviar at least once a week but have since tapered off to maybe once every six months. having an excess of canned beans all kinds in the cupboard i decided to make some bean soup. i got the ham bone in the pot and started emptying the cupboard.  this is the result tho measurements arent exact theyre close.  my dh ds and our mexican neighbor think i should patent this  it is probably too spicy hot for little ones.
