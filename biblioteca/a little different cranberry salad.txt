after mixing the jello and hot water until jello is dissolved  put in refrigerator until slightly set remove from refrigerator and add the sour cream and cranberry sauce and the walnuts and celery if using put back in the refrigerator until set
i found this recipe back in the 1960s and just love it.  in browsing through the other cranberry salad recipes on here i didnt see one using sour cream so wanted to post.   it is really good so give it a try. you could use sugarfree jello and light sour cream to reduce the calories. cooking time is the time to set in the refrigerator.
