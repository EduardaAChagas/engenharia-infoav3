pizza burgers lack many things among them pepperoni here is our version which we feel is totally pizza try it with our recipe 255242 which is packed with pizza flavor and requires no cooking suggested from a friend instead of patting burgers with a spatula on a tv cooking show the chef placed an indent in the middle of the raw patty with their thumb. as the burgers cook the indent recedes and the burger keeps its shape. havent tried it yet but will let you know if it works. apparently a good way to check the doneness too.
