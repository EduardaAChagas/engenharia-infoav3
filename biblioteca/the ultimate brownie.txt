preheat your oven to 365 degrees f and grease a 9x13 pan melt the chocolate and butter in pan over low heat and set aside just make sure it doesnt burn  in a large bowl  beat the eggs  sugar  and vanilla at high speed doing this for 10 minutes would be ideal but your brownies wont be ruined if you dont mix in the chocolate  butter mix  flour  and salt until just combined fold in the nuts pour into the prepared pan and bake for 3237 minutes
an amazingly chewy fudgy brownie not for folks who like their brownies more cakelike. i found this recipe on about.com while searching for a recipe that used baking squares instead of cocoa powder. the result a brownie that is super easy to make and comes out perfectly every time i like to add a pinch each of baking powder and baking soda but its not necessary especially if you can beat the eggsugar mix for 10 minutes...
unsweetened chocolate squares butter eggs sugar vanilla flour salt pecans
