i made this for dinner a few nights ago and it was just perfect. the seasonings from the store bought rotisserie chicken and fresh rosemary really made this dish sing. i always buy wedges of real parmasano reggiano cheese and store it in the freezer. it will last you a very long time so the expense is definitely worth the incredible flavor this cheese will add to your dish. my photo is not one of my best as i was using a friends camera but i wanted to make sure that everyone could identify the pasta shape.
