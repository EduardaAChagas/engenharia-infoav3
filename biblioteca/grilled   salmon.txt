just spray cast iron skillet with cooking spray and turn burner on high rub seasonings on both sides salmon when pan is smoking hot  add salmon cook for about 23 minutes turn and cook for another 23 minutes turn again if needed to prevent meat from burning turn electric burner off immediately cover skillet and leave it on the hot burner another 45 minutes or until meat is done do not overcook  as the meat will dry out it will look as if it were cooked on the grill  nice and brown on the outside and juicy on the inside i also use this same method to cook boneless  skinless chicken breasts and boneless pork loin chops and vary the seasonings to complement the meat with just a tiny bit of practice  youll know exactly how long to let the skillet sit on the burner after you have turned it off so you get the meat done and its still very juicy
i use this delicious fatfree method of cooking salmon chicken and pork chops at least 23 times a week varying the meats and seasonings.
