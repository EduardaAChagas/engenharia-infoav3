i love the heat associated with chili and when i think chili i think an immense amount of heat equally balanced with flavor. this can all be done in a crock pot which is my actual recommendation but you need to par cook or sear the meats before placing them into the crock pot. youll need a large crock pot for this chili which contains beef chuck ground beef hot italian sausage and bacon plus canned beans and plenty of hotness from chiles.
