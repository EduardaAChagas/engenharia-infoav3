peel and chop oranges into bite size pieces core and chop apples into bite size pieces peel and chop bananas into bite size pieces add walnuts and salad dressing some people like more salad dressing  some less you judge stir chill if you have less people  just use less fruit this is good in the summer time too
we have this at the holidays like everyone else for 3 generations. its very easy and very good. a good beginning job for the cooks that want to help. the faster you peel and chop the faster this dish is lol.
