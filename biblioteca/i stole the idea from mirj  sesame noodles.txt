i love mirjs funky chicken with sesame noodles. i decided to use the noodles as my inspiration for this recipe. its really similar but totally different. we liked it and i hope others will too cook time is the time it takes to make the pasta. update since posting this i tried adding about 12 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it turned out wonderfully so i decided to add it as a suggestion.
