heat bacon grease add onion and fry until golden add flour  salt and pepper and cook until light brown  stirring constantly add canned tomatoes  sugar  bay leaf and celery leaves or celery salt cook for another five minutes remove bay leaf rub through a strainer or serve without straining for chunkier sauce adjust seasonings to taste
from an index card in a recipe box i bought at a garage sale in 1960. the recipe uses canned tomatoes but i have also used fresh tomatoes with great results too. substitute olive or vegetable oil for the bacon grease if you like but the taste wont be quite the same. good with meatloaf or for serving with leftovers or biscuits.
