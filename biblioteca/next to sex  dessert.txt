i have noticed several variations of this recipe posted on zaar but this version came from rachel my mil.  she got the recipe from one of her dearest friends.  rachel notes that 2 boxes of instant butterscotch pudding can be used in place of the chocolate and vanilla pudding and that nuts andor coconut can be added on top of the finished dessert.  time to make does not include cooling time for crust.
