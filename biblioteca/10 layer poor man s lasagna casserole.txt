i had to come up with a kidadult friendly recipe to please everybody while my stepdaughter was visiting. so this is what i did. we all loved this it ended up making a lot though so you might want to make a half a recipe. ill be taking this to the next potluck or family gathering that comes up it was so good it came out way better than i thought it would. i was quite surprised and happy hope you try it
