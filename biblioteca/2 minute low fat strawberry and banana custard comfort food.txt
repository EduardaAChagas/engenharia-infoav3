put the kettle on spoon custard into microwaveable bowl and microwave on full until it rises  when its bubbling near the top of the bowl stop microwave and leave to stand whilst  leaving peel on banana  chop it in half you might fancy the other half in a minute  but it will otherwise keep ok for a couple of days on the top shelf in the refrigerator  peel the half banana  discard peel holding banana lengthways in your hand  slice it lengthways right thru then rotate it and slice lengthways again so its quartered into long quarters supporting it in your hand and fingers chop it roughly at quarter inches intervals lengthways to end up with lots of hasty cut chunky segments disperse the banana bits across the top of the custard get a small pot or egg cup and spoon a generous teaspoon of your favourite strawberry jam  jelly into it pour on a little of the hot water from the kettle  just enough to make it runny enough to pour like a thick sauce across the top of the banana bits pour strawberry sauce across top of bananas and custard and put the bowl back into microwave for about 45 seconds so you dont want to boil it  just hot take out and if it seems hot enough pour over a teaspoon or so of granulated sweetener  to taste sprinkle cinnamon across the top and serve not a lot to it but its quick  sweet  very tasty and very enjoyable and its a great way to use up bananas that are too soft and squishy plus you wont blow up like a balloon on the caloric load  unless you eat two dozen portions  it wont matter if the bananas are still very fresh as once heated they soften and sweeten a lot
i needed a delicious sugary fix and fast and as im suffering a bit a of a coldflu virus as i type this and much to my extreme irritation i can hardly taste anything   i guess my body needs extra energy to fight off the infection  well this will certainly help boost the energy and this really simple and extremely sweet strawberrybanana instant dessert certainly tastes great   i wanted as few calories and fat as i could persuade my cravings to settle for  so obviously there are a few  but theyre all made up of good stuff  very little fat and not so many calories that im being ridiculous.
