this pulled pork could not be easier i used a pork loin roast for this but you could used tenderloin. i  trimmed off the huge slab of fat on the side but you dont have to. i also used about 16 oz of homemade bbq instead of the bottled stuff. the pork turned out very tender i served this on toasted hamburger buns with creamy slaw pickles and some hot sauce.
