had never heard of johnny marzetti until recently stumbling on his recipe in some newspaper website. actually research shows marzettis restaurant in columbus ohio was the source of this great comfort food dish back in the 20s ..is it still there. have seen ingredients of several versions of this dish here but none with all these great ingredients. this is an ultimate comfort food that is even better at the second and third sitting. i think that the sausage and italian cheese blend is key to success of this rendition. dish is great with a nice green salad.
