to make soup put all the soup ingredients in a blender process for 45seconds to 1 minute  or until you have a completely smooth puree taste and adjust seasoning empty into a foodsafe container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to marry flavours to make crme fraiche drizzle combine crme fraiche with finelyminced fresh dill refrigerate until ready to use to serve serve soup in pretty white bowls  if you have them  as the colour is so amazing drizzle with the crme fraiche and top each with a fresh sprig of dill
this is a wickedlygood concoction  a soup thats perfect for summer the colour is so beautiful  a deep rich vermillion  and with a drizzle or dollop of dillinfused crme fraiche its nearly too pretty to eat. fortunately the taste lives up to the stunning visual
