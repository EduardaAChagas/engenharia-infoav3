divide the meat into 3 evenly sized burgers and seasoned with lawrys seasoned salt to taste cook the burgers to the desired doneness on a griddle or in a large castiron skillet top the burgers with a handful of cheese  then top each one with a bun let the cheese melt a bit and then add a couple ice cubes to the pan around the cheese cover and cook until the cheese melts completely the ice melts and adds just the right amount of steam to melt the cheese and keep the meat moist while the cheese melts  make up the bottom buns to your liking with pickles  onions  tomatoes  and lettuce once the cheese melts into a skirt around the the burger and browns on the bottom  place the burgers on the bottom buns  cheese and all cool slightly so the cheese sets serve
adapted from a recipe courtesy of squeeze inn. from diners driveins and dives cookbook. frying these on a hot griddle the owner takes a 13 pound handful of cheddar cheese to top  a 13 pound burger pattie. the cheese spreads out ice is placed around it and the top bun is put in place before the whole thing is covered to let it steam. they use flattop burgers which i like because you get that nice caramelized crisp on the meat. so when making the patties dont make them too round flatten them out. this really works. youre gonna love it.guy fieriand i say i second that.
