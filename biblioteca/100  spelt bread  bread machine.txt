please ingredients in loaf pan in order suggested by manufacturer set to rapid bake  light crust
from the uk website www.sharphampark.com converted to imperial measures and slightly modified. adjust the yield below to match your bread machine capacity. personally i make a 1 lb loaf in a black  decker bread machine designed for a 112 lb loaf. for a slightly different loaf use 3 12 cups spelt flour and 12 cup quinoa flour. note the rapid bake cycle on my bread machine is approx. 2 hours long. i have noticed that some bread machines have a super rapid cycle of approx. 1 hour. i doubt this recipe would work on a super rapid cycle. note on nutrition values the nutrition values for the spelt flour and almond milk are not included in the nutrition table. it appears food.com does not have spelt flour and almond milk in their database.
