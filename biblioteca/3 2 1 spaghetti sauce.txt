in a large stock pot brown burger and drain brown sliced sausage and drain saut onions and bell pepper for a few minutes add garlic  seasonings and bay leaf saut 1 more minute add all meat back to the pot add tomato sauce and diced tomatoes stir to mix well and bring to a boil reduce heat  cover and simmer 1 hour add the tomato paste and cook and stir a few more minutes
this is done in about an hour and a half. makes enough to freeze for later when time doesnt allow to cook. the name comes from the ingredients. i finally found how much tomato sauce it takes to thicken using 1 small can of tomato paste.
