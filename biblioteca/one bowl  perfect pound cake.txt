this is the perfect pound cake recipe...plus so easy to prepare and only one bowl to wash this is a firm cake so if you are into cutting and shaping cakes this works well. i have used it for christening and communion cakes creating crosses etc and used buttercream frosting. i have also made it in a 9 x 13 cake pan...just adjust time accordingly. the addition of the yogurt really makes a difference in the taste.
