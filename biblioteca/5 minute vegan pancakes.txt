set out all your ingredients set a stove element with a pan to medium heat combine the 4 dry ingredients in a bowl add the soy milk and vegetable oil to your mixture mix until smooth now the pan should be ready for your batter  so spoon one pancakes worth of the mixture into the pan flip carefully when you see bubbles in the middle of the pancake  or if the edges are looking stiffened repeat until the batter is gone  and try not to eat them all while youre cooking them
