my mum used to make this all the time when we were kids. i used to make it for my dh who absolutely loved it but now his diet wont allow him to have it. it can be made with all lemons or all oranges whatever takes your fancy or whatever you may have an abundance of. mums recipe was written in pints and not litres so i have left it this way but the amount you get depends on the size of the bottles and when serving you may like to add more or use less cordial pending on your taste.
