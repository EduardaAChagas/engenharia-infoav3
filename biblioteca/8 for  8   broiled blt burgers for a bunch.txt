dice bacon into small pieces and fry in a skillet until just done  but not crispy use a slotted spoon and place bacon bits onto a paper towel lined plate to drain and cool in a large bowl  combine the hamburger  cooled bacon bits  dried minced onion  seasoning salt  and the cheese mix thoroughly and divide the mixture into 8  1  4 pound patties place the patties onto a wax paper lined sheet pan and cover with plastic wrap place the sheet pan into fridge for approx 2 hours  or you could place the sheet pan in the freezer for an hour and then wrap each patty in wax paper and put them all in a ziplock bag to keep in the freezer to use later meanwhile  make the spread by combining the salad dressing and mustard in a small bowl  cover with plastic wrap  and place it into the fridge until needed when ready to cook  remove patties from fridge and place on counter to get the chill off place an oven rack in the center position of the oven and turn it to the broil setting place patties onto a broiler pan  and place in heated oven broil approx 5  6 minutes  flip over and broil to desired temp remove when done  and let rest on top of the stove tent the pan with foil leave broiler on lay the buns on the center rack  split side up  and lightly toast them keep an eye on them  they go quick  slather each toasted bun with some of the spread mixture  and add a patty top with a leaf of lettuce  a slice of tomato and the top of the bun enjoy  im sure these would grill up just fine on a gas or charcoal grill i only had the use of 2 ovens  broilers at the church when i cooked these also  they do travel well if you premake the patties at home and want to take them elsewhere to cook
save your money and shop wisely i was able to make 32 homemade yummy hamburgers quarter pounders for 32.00. ive cut this recipe down to 8 for family portion size. make however big or small of a batch you may need. for the 32 burgers i purchased the following 8 lbs of 8020 ground beef  2.19lb 17.52 1 lb bacon  3.49lb 2  8oz blocks of cheese  24.00 2 heads of iceberg lettuce  0.69ea 1.38 4 large tomatoes  0.49ea 1.96 4  8ct pkgs of buns  0.89ea 3.65. my grand total was 32.00 exactly the key to this is to buy everything when it is on sale and freeze it okay you cant freeze the veggies but all else you can. i hope this recipe comes in handy for anyone wanting to feed a crowd. and it sure beats the value meal burgers and these are so much better i created this on very short notice to feed to a group of 30 men that were staying at a local church for the evening. they loved the burgers so i was happy. i hope you enjoy
