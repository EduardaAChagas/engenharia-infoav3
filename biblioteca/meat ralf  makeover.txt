preheat oven to 350 mix ground meats together until blended well if using italian sausage slices brown first and add last to keep them from falling apart mix egg  cream  and 1  2 cup tomato sauce together then mix into meat using your hands seems to be the easiest way  dont forget to wash and remove your rings add breadcrumbs  finely minced garlic and onion  worcestershire sauce  salt  and pepper dont be afraid to use the cayenne powder its not enough to burn you and it really gives the dish a lot of flavor mix well form into a large loaf pan bake at 350 for 1 hour  top with remaining tomato sauce or ketchup  dust with salt and sugar  and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes you can use 2 small loaf pans if you reduce the baking time by 15 minutes serve with your favorite fresh veggie or garlic mashed potatoes
i came up with this recipe while working at a small town restaurant. i hated even the idea of as my mom calls it meatralf but the owner wanted to add it to our menu. i set out on a mission to create an edible meatloaf. to the delight of our patrons it wasnt only edible it was delicious. even my mom loves it. for a gourmet twist i substitute ground sausage with slices of italian sausage links also diced canned tomatoes and fresh basil leaves instead of tomato sauce.
