1 cup ratio is just a suggestion make as much or as little as you like mix 2 oz of grain mix with 2 cups of jasmine or basmati rice cook rice and grains in a rice cooker using equal amounts of rice  grains and water to make sushi  add 1  3 cup rice vinegar  2 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp salt  whisk together completetly and add to cooled rice mix see my recipe for smoky risotto for a great side dish including this blend 
this is a mix of grains that i make in bulk quantities to use as a replacement for rice or as a flavorful addition to jasmine or basmati rice.  with all due respect this is based on a recipe from the medicine restaurant in san francisco.  also great for sushi
