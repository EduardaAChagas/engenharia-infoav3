authentic northern indian garam masala.  while each family seems to have their own personal blend the ones ive seen on zaar are highly questionable so i felt the need to post my own. this is in the punjabi style as taught to me by the owner of a pakistani restaurant. all spices are whole unless otherwise specified and can be found at your local indian market.
