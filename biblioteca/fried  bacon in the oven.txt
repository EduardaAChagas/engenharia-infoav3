to avoid grease splatters on the top of your stove or having to wash an extra splatter screen  simply put bacon in a cast iron skillet with the lid on in a preheated 450 oven for about 15 minutes remove the skillet  drain the bacon  and the oven stays clean and so does the top of your stove enjoy now and  or you can crumble up the leftover bacon to use in omelets or other recipes for later simply put them in a freezer bag and use later its especially efficient when youve already heated the oven for another dish
