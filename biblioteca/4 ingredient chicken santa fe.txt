dump the corn and beans into a crock pot put the chicken over that  and pour the salsa over the top cook on low 810 hours shred the chicken with a fork and mix well before serving we like to roll this up in tortillas  but it is also good over rice or filling sandwiches you can serve this with sour cream  shredded cheese  etc  but it really isnt necessary
supereasy superhealthy and everyone loves it  i believe this was credited to taste of home magazine.
