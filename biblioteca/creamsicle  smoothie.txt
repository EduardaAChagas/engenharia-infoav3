peel mangoes and remove as much flesh around pit as you can peel oranges if you have a good blender  dont worry about the orange seeds  theyll get blended up just fine  as well as the vanilla bean put all ingredients in blender  blend to desired consistency and consume  makes 3 large servings
we named this smoothie the creamsicle smoothie because to us its tastes just like a creamsicle.  so good
