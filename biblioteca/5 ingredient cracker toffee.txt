preheat the oven to 400 degrees line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil i spray it with nonstick cooking spray like pam to help with the sticking  and of course you can always use more butter place the crackers side by side on the tray forming a large rectangle this will make the caramel and chocolate easier to spread over high heat  combine the butter and brown sugar in a saucepan stirring constantly  bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes after boiling pour caramel mixture over crackers and spread evenly to the edges i use an offset spatula for this bake for 5 minutes  pull out and sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the crackers bake for 3 minutes more  pull out and spread the softened chocolate chips evenly over the caramel change the oven setting to a high broil then sprinkle the pecans evenly over all and place back in the oven for up to a minute  but you really have to stand by and watch since all broilers differ be careful or you will burn your nuts  chill in the freezer for 15 minutes or until set peel the foil away and break into pieces store in a covered  airtight container in the refrigerator
