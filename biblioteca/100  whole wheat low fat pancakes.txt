depending on your preference blend  mix all ingredients except fruit heat pan on medium till drop of water dances in pan pour batter into pan to desired size of pancake  if using fruit add small handfuls to individual cakes after pouring into pan when bubbles appear on surface and begin to sink flip and cook on other side until brown repeat with remaining batter until all gone serve with favorite topping i e  fruit  syrup  jam etc
i created these one day for my kiddies when i couldnt find a recipe that fit my bill. they turned out great note if you like fluffy pancakes stir wet ingredients into dry with a wooden spoon leaving some lumps more lumpsbigger cakes alternately if you like thin pancakes like me use your blender to mix all the ingredients at once and blend until smooth update sept 07 for those who dont like really thick pancakes try reducing flour by 12cup and replacing it with milk this will give a runnier batter and should give a thinner pancake thanks for the comments everyone good and bad we all learn from critisism too
