we love pizzaeven for breakfast. feel free to add any of your favorite toppings too. this is very filling and great served with fresh fruit. also super as a light lunch or supper. i will make a couple of these on the weekend and wrap individual wedges that the kids grab to pop in the micro and eat as they wait for the bus.
