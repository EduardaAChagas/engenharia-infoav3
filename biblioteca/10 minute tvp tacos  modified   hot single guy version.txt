the taco seasoning ingredients are to be use if you dont have any premixed taco seasoning  but if you do  then just omit them and add a bit more cayenne to taste the taco seasoning ingredients will yield enough to make this recipe four times  so mix  measure 1  1  2 tsp and save the rest dump the water  diced onion  beef or vegetable boullion  tvp  spice and yeast flakes in a 1 quart sauce pan and heat on medium low heat  stirring continually until almost all the water is absorbed add the olive oil and sliced red peppers and onions  stirring continually and fry for a couple of minutes to just soften the onions add the salsa  stir to warm it up and remove from heat this mix is enough to generously fill 2 10 inch flour tortillas cut the tomatoes in strips or dice them as a garnish  and sprinkle some cheese on top  then wrap it up and enjoy you can also add shredded lettuce if you have some i didnt
i guess i should rephrase that.  its not just for single guys or hot ones for that matter i modified the quantity for a single person and made it more spicy.  this is based on the 10 minute tvp tacos recipe posted by queenkungfu httpwww.recipezaar.com10minutetvptacos289559 but modified partly because i didnt have taco seasoning mix on hand i wanted a cooking for one recipe and i just cant seem to follow instructions.    aside from the water and tvp quantities are approximate since i dont measure much.
