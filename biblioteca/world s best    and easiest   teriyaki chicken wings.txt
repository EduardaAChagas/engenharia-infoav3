mix sauce and sugar together  brush on both sides of the wings  then pour over wings in pan cook in a roasting pan  cookie sheet with alip so the sauce doesnt spill and make a mess of the oven 350 degrees cook for 1 hour i usually cook face down for about 40 minutes and then flip over then when done throw all the gooey sauce into the crock pot with the wings and simmer on low heat for as long as you want this is what makes them fall apart in your mouth  but you dont have to do it to cook them they should be done after an hour in the oven
these wings fall apart in your mouth your guests or family will be fighting over them.
