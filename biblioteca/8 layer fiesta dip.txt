spread unheated beans in the bottom of a 9x11 size glass dish or glass baking pan pour enchilada sauce evenly over the beans spoon on guacamole and spread evenly in a separate dish  mix together the taco seasoning and the sour cream until well blended spoon this sour cream mixture over the guacamole and spread around evenly sprinkle cheese on top of these layers until you have a complete layer of cheese drain the cans of black olives and sprinkle them evenly on top of the cheese do the same with the green onions  and then finally with the diced tomatoes cover tightly and chill in refrigerator for about 2 hours now  invite a few friends over  set it on the table with some tortilla chips  and watch it disappear  this dish will keep for about a week if tightly covered in the refrigerator combine a few spoonfuls of this dip with taco meat and place in tortillas or taco shells for an amazing ready to eat meal 
this is so much better than your average 7 layer bean dip youll never want to eat that boring dip again make sure to try to use the same brand of enchilada sauce....ive found it really makes a big difference in the taste of the entire dish. this recipe is always gone within 20 minutes and every party that i take it to
