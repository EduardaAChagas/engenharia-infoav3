preheat oven to 450f rinse the chicken breasts  and either cut or pound the chicken to create cutlets of about equal size tear off squares of aluminum foil and place each chicken breast on a square slice the tomato and place a slice or two atop of each breast drizzle the chicken with the olive oil sprinkle the basil on top of the chicken breasts evenly add salt and pepper to each breast loosely fold up the foil over each cutlet  leaving both room for air space but folded up enough not to allow oil to drip out place all packages in a large baking dish and bake for 20 minutes serve while still packaged allow each diner to open his  her package at the table
this creates a great aroma when the packages are first opened at the tablethe packages hold the flavors in the chicken. im a huge chicken fan and this is a very simple but tasty way to serve it.
