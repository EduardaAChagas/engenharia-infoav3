from dining in ive always wanted to find a kosher cream of chicken soup recipe and now i have one  i had to play around a bit with the amount of liquids especially when cooking the rice because i used an immersion blender... it might work okay as listed with a food processor.
onion oil water raw rice chicken stock salt and pepper frozen peas cooked chicken
