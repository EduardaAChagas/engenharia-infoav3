these muffins are a blessing for people restricted to lowfat foods there is only about 1 gram of fat in each muffin these muffins do not at all taste lowfat this recipe will make 36 muffins so just pop them into the freezer for a fatfree snack or for breakfast if desired add in chopped nuts although that will add to the fat content you can use egg beaters in place of eggs and white sugar in place of brown or use half of each.
