i have tried lots of variations of gluten free bread but i wanted a recipe that i didnt have to search high and low for the different flours this recipe has also cooked the best so far in my bread maker machine.  better yet i could get all the flours in one stop at the organic store.  tip asian markets have potato starch and tapioca and rice flour toothis recipe is butterbasted white bread i got this from a book in the library i cannot remember the title or author.i make this bread for my mother and friend who cannot have gluten in their diet.  they rave that this is better than the small store loafs and love that it cuts without crumbling and ideal for sandwiches toast etc they both prefer the 1 white1 brown rice flour mix with linseed and sunflower seeds for taste and texture.  the minimum setting i have on my bread machine is 4 hours the bread cooks fine on this for me.produces a smaller loaf than wheat bread loafs but still a decent size.
