our son always loved this recipe. he never knew it was made with youknowwhat fake crab until after he worked on a crab boat a few years ago of course you can always use real crab. its easy to put together and with a salad it makes a nice meal. i always make it with lowfat sour cream lowfat soup and i just use butter flavored cooking spray to replace the butter. when done this way it cuts out almost all the fat and its still good.
