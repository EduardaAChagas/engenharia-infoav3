saute onions until they are clear and soft add ginger and garlic  saute on medium heat for about 3 minutes  making sure not to burn the garlic add the veat to the mixture  and make sure you have the onion  garlic  ginger mix dispersed evenly within the veat add ketchup  maple syrup  tabasco  vinegar  salt  pepper  and crushed red pepper to veat and stir well i am just guessing at these measurements taste the mix now  if it needs more of something then feel free to add it  since there is no meat involved  the bbq does not have to cook for a certain amount of time  but i prefer eating mine hot  so i get it bubbling  and then serve on a bun 
i invented this recipe several years ago when i was involved in music promotion in the area and we had bands coming through and staying at our house at least once a week lots were vegetarian and even more were not from the south so i wanted to give them something satisfying and a taste of my home.  but i needed to keep the meat eaters happy too.  this was the result.  whenever i make this now my roommates call their friends and people just happen to drop by just in time for dinnerthere are many secrets to this recipe but one of which is the specific meat substitute used... its awesomeall of these measurements are approximate.
