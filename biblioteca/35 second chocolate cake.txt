spray a coffee cup or ramekin with vegetable cooking spray in the cup combine the flour  splenda  cocoa powder  baking powder  coffee crystals and salt until no lumps remain stir in the milk  olive oil  and vanilla until smooth bake in the microwave on high for 35 seconds you may need to add 5 more seconds but dont be tempted to overcook or it will be rubbery  it should be moist on the bottom and will continue cooking as it sets serve with chocolate saucea sprinkle of powdered sugarwhipped cream or eat plain as a brownie
now heres a sweet little sweetie that you can mix and cook in the cup and in  alright maybe 1 12 minutes tops  youll have a cute little cutie for a guilt free snack.  but its only 35 seconds in the microwaveso there  soooo good for so not a lot of work the best part  no huge 16serving monstrosity sitting on your counter staring you down every time you pass by the kitchen. i found this recipe on eating well living thin. i thought this made a nice little chocolaty snack. when i made this cake i did use the coffee crystals but i used vegetable oil in place of the olive oil. i did serve mine plain at first then i poured a bit of sugar free hersheys chocolate syrup over the cake and topped it with canned whipped cream. while i thought the cake was a bit different tasting i thought it tasted better without the hersheys syrup.
