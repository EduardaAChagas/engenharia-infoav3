the original title is simply coleslaw. i added the 1940s as this recipe is for a request for coleslaw made with a cooked dressing. since most dressings for coleslaw today are not cooked and this book is from the 40s i renamed the recipe to help distinguish it from todays typical deli fare.
cabbage apple egg yolks sugar butter salt cream vinegar cayenne pepper egg whites dry mustard flour paprika egg milk
