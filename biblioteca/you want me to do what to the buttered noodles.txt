boil water and prepare noodles as directed on the package in a saucepan melt butter once the butter is melted stir and watch once the butter begins to turn golden and then brown wait until the butter has turned medium to dark brown and take off of heat drain noodles and pour butter over them the butter will sizzle when it hits the noodles there will be little brown flecks on the noodles
after years of eating at good and plenty and plain and fancy in lancaster county my mother finally worked up the courage to ask the waitress how they make the buttered noodles.  just burn the butter. i know it sounds weird but this has become our familys favorite way to prepare buttered noodles. plus no additional seasoning needed
egg noodles butter
