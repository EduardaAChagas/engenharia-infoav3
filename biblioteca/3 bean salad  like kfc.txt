whisk together the dressing ingredients in a medium bowl stir in the veggies being sure to coat all refrigerate overnight in covered container serve using a slotted spoon
i found this recipe as a copycat to a national chicken franchises recipe. even people who dont like beans will love them in this recipe. i dont always use green peppers because some family members refuse to eat them. recipe is great with or without them. the salad actually starts to taste better the longer it sits in the dressing.
