combine first 5 ingredients  season with salt and pepper and chill while this is chilling  combine the last 4 ingredients in a nonreactive pot simmer form meat mixture into balls and lay out in a 9x13 baking dish you dont need to bake them or brown them  they hold together well  as long as they chill first you can now carefully add the meatballs to your sauce and simmer for 1 hour or you can pour the sauce over the meatballs  cover them with foil  and bake 1 hour at 325f love you  mom
i have to use gf breadcrumbs but otherwise these are hers.  i tried to find a similar recipe here... i thought everyone put cranberries in the sauce i emailed mom for the recipe and the directions are in her words. this meatball is sweet moist and tangy.  best of all it is easy.  as with my second favorite meatballs serving size is debatable. enjoy.
