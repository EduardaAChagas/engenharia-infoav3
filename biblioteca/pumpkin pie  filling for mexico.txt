i live in chapala jalisco mexico and canned pumpkin is rather expensive as it is imported.  i have worked out what i believe to be a rather good substitute.  i usually for go the crust and bake it as a custard of sorts. where do i get the brown sugar cooked camotes  from the guy with the wheelbarrow on the plaza in chapala or sometimes in the arcade there is a lady selling them.  you will notice there is no sugar added..... thats how sweet these camotes are.
