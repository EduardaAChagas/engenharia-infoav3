i ran across this recipe a few years back from my local grocery store. i was very skeptical that one could actually cook an entire turkey regardless of size in about 2 hours and have it be edible. well not only does this actually work it produces the best roasted turkey ive had to date. no more getting up at 4 a.m. to start the holiday turkey amazing now ive heard everything. no more basting. its so incredibly fast and easy. it has become the only way i roast turkeys. turkey...its not just for holidays anymore. the biggest turkey i made this way was 22.5 pounds. it took about 2 hours 15 minutes to cook. wow. gobble gobble
