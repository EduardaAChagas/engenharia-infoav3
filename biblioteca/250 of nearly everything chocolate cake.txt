preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius grease the base an 89inch diameter springform cake tin  and line with greaseproof or baking paper melt the butter and chocolate in a double boiler stir every so often and set aside to cool when there are no lumps separate the eggs into two different bowls beat the yolks  then add the caster sugar beat until pale  thick and creamy add the almonds  and mix to combine well add the chocolate mixture and stir until well combined beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form gently fold into the chocolate almond mixture until well combined pour into the prepared cake tin and bake for 4050 minutes make sure the top does not burn  when a skewer is inserted there will still be some mixture attached to it  but it will be soft as opposed to uncooked remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin when cool  remove from the tin you will need to run a knife around the edges put on a plate after having removed the baking paper on the base melt the remaining chocolate until there are no lumps  and pour in stages over the cake until the chocolate is evenly spread down the sides and over the top this is very rich but is nice served with orange sorbet to cut through the richness
this is great for people who are on a nonwheat diet.  you can also substitute ground hazelnuts for the almonds if you wish.  i think this recipe was in a cuisine new zealand recipe book.  the cake will be quite fudgy and not dry in the middle.  it will also sink a little as it cools so dont worry if this happens
