salad  the tomatoes should be lightly seeded and then rough chopped then added to a medium size bowl add the cucumbers  onion and toss lightly add the nakano rice vinegar  salt and pepper and toss lightly if you only have access to plain rice vinegar 1  8 teaspoon dried oregano and dried basil can be added to 1  2 cup to plain rice wine vinegar to obtain the same flavor but the nakano is well worth purchasing even online it can be used for so many dishes croutons  in a small baggie or ziplock bag  add the croutons with a meat mallet  rolling pin  can  or just your hand  crunch up the croutons not to fine  just a rough texture finishing  top the bowl with the croutons and lightly toss serving  i love to serve this on a lettuce leaf and a sprig of fresh basil for a elegant presentation i usually serve a toasted baguette on the side or if it is just everyday  just serve it as is it is a great simple salad 
fresh summer ingredients well year round with our farmers market in fl but this can be made any time of the year for a nice change from a lettuce salad.  now i use nakano seasoned rice vinegar basil  oregano but you can use any brand.  this is available on the web or at many grocery stores.  all of our grocery stores in fl carry it and it is well worth the purchase. low fat no oil needed healthy and is great on seafood salads and vegetables.  i use it all the time.
