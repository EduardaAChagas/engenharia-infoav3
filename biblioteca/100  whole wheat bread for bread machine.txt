i based this recipe on one for honey whole wheat bread i found on the back of a bag of hodgson mill flour. i could never keep that one from falling in my bread machine so i came up with this. there is literally no preparation involved just throw all the ingredients into the container. it is the only completely whole wheat bread recipe ive used that turns out well for me every time.
