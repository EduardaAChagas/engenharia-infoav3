adopted recipe.the original recipe calls for baking in the oven but you could also make this in a slow cooker on low if you dont want to tie up your oven for that long. this is a very easy stew to make. there isnt much prep to it just some rough chopping of the veggies.make sure you dont lift the foil in the oven bc the steam helps cook the veggies just rightthis would be great with a nice crusty bread on the side.
