place everything in order in a bowl and mix butter one side of your bread and put on a medium hot griddle top with the amount of pimiento cheese spread you want butter the other slice of bread and put butter side up grill until golden brown it will drip down the sides if you use too much  but just makes it all the better remove and let sit for about a minute  to let cheese settle cut in half and serve drop a dollop on top of a bowl of chili melt slowly and serve as a nacho dip i add a little hot sauce to spice it up or about a 1  2 cup salsa for another kind of dip i have also used this to make macaroni and cheese cook your macaroni and drain mix the above mix  you may have to increase the amounts to make it cheesy enough add about 1 cup of milk pour into greased casserole and bake about 45 minutes at 400
this is not your typical grilled cheese sandwich.  it takes some time to mix together but the end results are really good.  you can use it for more than just a grilled cheese sandwich.  this can also be melted slowly for an awesome dip.  top a bowl of chili with this mix.  mix it with cooked macaroni for a different mac and cheese but amounts will have to be adjusted to your cheesy taste
