this recipe comes from my sis in n.c. it is a simple nofuss fruit dip that is a little different from all the rest. the taste of this dip is incredible and everyone who has tried it has loved it. i like to cut the fruits into bitesized pieces and stick a toothpick into each one serve the fruit on a platter with the dip in the middle. perfect summer appetizer
