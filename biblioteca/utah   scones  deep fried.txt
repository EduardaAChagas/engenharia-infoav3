dissolve yeast in the 1  2 cup of warm water add the tablespoon of sugar to the yeastwater mixture and set aside beat the 3 eggs in a small bowl and set aside put honey  brown sugar  smart balance  and salt in a large bowl add 1 cup boiling water to the large bowl add the 3 beaten eggs to the large bowl and mix add the yeast mixture to the large bowl slowly add the flour to the large bowl while mixing continue beating the mixture with a mixer until smooth cover the bowl with a dish towel  and let the dough rise for 1 hour refrigerate the dough until cold roll the dough out on a floured surface to about 1  4 thin heat oil with a high smoke point in a deepfryer or electric skillet to around 350 degrees f make sure not to use olive oil  as it has a low smoke point and is not suited for deepfrying use a deepfrying thermometer to check the temperature of the oil  if at all possible if your oil starts to smoke  turn off the heat  let the oil cool  then throw out the oil its no good while oil is heating  cut the dough into pieces  4 inch squares seem best to me  but you can make them smaller or larger fry the pieces of dough in the heated oil  preferably one at a time  until puffy and golden brown remove from oil using an allmetal utensil place on paper towels to cool  but serve warm with the topping of your choice
these are not scones as the rest of the world knows them...i just call them utah scones.  theyre basically like frybread sopapillas elephant ears... delicious and completely unhealthy.  this recipe includes my slightly healthy ingredientsnot that it actually makes them healthy but you at least feel slightly better about eating them   best served with honey jam or the topping of your choice some people like peanut butter orange marmalade powdered sugar etc..
