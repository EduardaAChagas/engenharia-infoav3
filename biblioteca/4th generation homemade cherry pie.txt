this is a from scratch recipe. it takes me 45 min to put it together but ive been making it since i was 7. it may take you somewhat longer but it is very worth it especially with some vanilla ice cream on the side. my grandmother first got this recipe from her mother who got it off of an old crisco container. that right there should tell you how good it is i love cherry pie but i cant stand those super sweet one with the bing cherry filling. this is just right balance of tart and sweet. and with the homemade crust it practically melts in your mouth. hope you all enjoy
