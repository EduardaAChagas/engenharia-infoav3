pre heat oven to 350 add bananas and oats to a bowl mash until creamed together  i used a fork add additional oats if needed to should end up with a drop cookie consistency add whatever add ins youd like but try to keep the dough moist enough to hold the cookie together place on cookie sheet either by small dropfulls or spoon on and flatten top bake for 1215 mins
found this recipe online and tried it out. turned out yummy. probably the best recipe to start kids off baking cookies  the addins are endless. choc chipsnutsspicesfruit etc. when i made the second batch of these i added vanilla extract and choc chips turned out great. no secret to these... when you get a nice cookie dough consistency...its time to bake. the smaller you make them the less time they will take...and will determine how much you get out of a batch.
bananas quick oats
