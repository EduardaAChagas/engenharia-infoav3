my dad found this recipe and gave it to me.  it is inexpensive and delicious  my husband and his friends love it so when we have get togethers this is usually requested.  it is easily doubled or tripled and you can make a lighter version by using skim milk and light sour cream and cream cheese but i havent tried that.
