my interpretation of lemon blueberry streusel cake   95261 which was a variation of raspberry rhapsody chocolate streusel cake  94465.  the resulting texture is dense somewhere between a pound cake and a muffin defintely not a light airy cake.  the crunchy streusel topping really makes the cake. we ate it for dessert and breakfast. the combinations of cake mix pudding mix yogurt flavor  fruit can be altered per your taste.
