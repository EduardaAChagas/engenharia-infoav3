this is my own recipe for a yummy creamy thick cheesecake that is easy to make and sure to  dazzle anyone.i prefer to serve it topped with blackberries but you can use any fruit of your choice i bet kiwi with lime would be good too mmmm mabe ill go make another.to be completely honest i opt not to dig out my spring form pan and cheat by buying ready made crust from the store. although i have included ingredients and instructions for a crust for those who are looking for a completely home made cake. however if you are as lazy as i am and go with the ready made crust  tip keep that aluminum edge that keeps the clear plastic lid on folded up making an extra lip. it will help hold more cheesecake and keep it from overflowing. this is a nice thick cheesecake this cheesecake is made in three parts 1. crust 2. filling note filling is made in two stages whipped cream and filling and 3. topping note this topping is not the fruit topping but the top layer of the cheesecake.
