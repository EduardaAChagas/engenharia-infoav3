one of the first questions i asked on this site was for homemade v8 juice. have been constantly looking until the other day at the dentist office when the assistant gave me her mothers recipe. wow so simple and so good.071908 update  i made a large pitcherfull today and added about 112 tbsp of worcestershire sauce for an added kick. the guys really liked it  me....still like the original best. 091608 another update  i have now had two different members point out to me that the former name of this name of this recipe homemade v8 juice is a poor choice as it is not homemade.......and i agree thus the new name.
plain tomato juice old bay seasoning
