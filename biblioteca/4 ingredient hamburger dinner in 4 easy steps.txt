brown hamburger add seasoned salt  pepper  and vegetables simmer ten minutes serve
great for those times when you dont have much time or dont feel like spending a whole lot of time in the kitchen. this recipe was adapted from one taught to me by a friend. she would form the raw mixture into patties and wrap in foil and then take it along on their camping trips to cook on the fire.
