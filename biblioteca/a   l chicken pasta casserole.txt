i just had the pleasure of having two guests for lunch all the way from holland and dedicate this recipe to them  it is a do ahead casserole  just pop it in the oven 30 minutes before serving  watch you dont leave it longer you dont want it to get too dry.  this is a one dish meal serve with a green salad  crusty roll lovely for lunch or dinner  the 1 hour cooking time includes the time to brown  cook the chicken and precook the veggies.  everything in the casserole is precooked so you only have to heat it through before serving.
