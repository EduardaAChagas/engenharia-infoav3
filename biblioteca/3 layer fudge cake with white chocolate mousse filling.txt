i was looking for a beautiful rich cake to make for christmas this year and this was exactly what i was looking for i found this recipe online and it originally came from bon appetit. i wanted something chocolate and peppermint to go with the season. it turned out to be the best cake ive ever made my family wants it to be a tradition for me to make this cake every christmas from now on. i hope it turns out just as wonderful for you as it did for me it takes time but it is well worth it. the cookingpreparation time does not include the hours it needs to cool in between.
