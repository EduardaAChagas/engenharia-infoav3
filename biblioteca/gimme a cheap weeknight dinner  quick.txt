cmon admit it at some time in your life you have eaten hamburger helper. i know that it was a staple in our house when i was a kid. the little talking glove is comforting in a twisted kind of way. o anyway this recipe looks like hamburger helper but tastes much better. sure there are recipes out there that are probably better for you or tastier but when you are trying to eat quickly and on a budget this recipe is a must.
