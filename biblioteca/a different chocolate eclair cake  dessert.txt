most eclair cakes or desserts use graham crackers. i find that by using club crackers the desert actually tastes more like a true chocolate eclair. i find its not as sweet using the club crackers also.if you dont want to make the frosting use a ready made chocolate fudge frosting. just heat for a few seconds so its pourable. cook time is chill time.to make it lighter you can use sugar free pudding low fat milk low fat club crackers and sugar free cool whip.
