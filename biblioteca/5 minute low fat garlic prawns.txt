combine all ingredients in a bowl you can leave them to sit for a while if you want to  or if pressed for time  the flavours still work just as well if you cook it straight away heat wok to mediumhigh heat add prawns  wine  and garlic  and stirfry 45 minutes  or until prawns are just cooked through the tails will be bright pink  and the prawn meat will no longer be translucent remove from wok with a slotted spoon and serve immediately
i came up with this as a quick and easy lunch today.  it was tasty and used no added fats or oils.  i used my wok as it is the best nonstick surface i have.  feel free to use any good nonstick pan you have.  you could use this on its own in a salad tossed through pasta or as a topping for grilled steak.
