i think a fondue is a very romantic casual dinner or wonderful for after the theatre snack served with a robust red wine. for dinner serve with rice  a small salad. almond rice pilaf is a great accompaniment recipe posted separately  to cook the meat you must first heat your oil  i do this by heating it to almost boiling on the stove and then transfering it to your fondue burner. buy good quality meat i recommend only using a fillet. have at least 3 sauces. if you want to serve 46 people just increase the meat to 2 lbs there will be enough sauce.these sauce recipes came from
