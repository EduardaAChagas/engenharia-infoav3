i love the classic 7 layer salad and i love veggies so i just kept adding more ingredients and now its an 11 layer salad. i made it for thanksgiving one year and it was the talk of the party and gobbled up fast. i have been told this is the best layer salad recipe ever and i am asked to bring it to all holiday dinners. i think the double layering is the key. this makes a big salad
