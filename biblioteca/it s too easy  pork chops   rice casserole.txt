when i made this my husbands favorite the other night i was asked if id ever submitted this recipe to zaar.  i had to answer what recipe  so after throwing this together for over 20 years im writing down this nobrainer recipe for you to try which only takes around 10 minutes to prepare. optional  you may add fresh or canned sliced mushrooms to the pan if you wish.  2108note using creamed soups will totally change the texture of this dish.
