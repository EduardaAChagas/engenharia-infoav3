melt the white chocolate and shortening in a doubleboiler pour onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or wax paper drop a few drops of red food coloring onto the chocolate  scattered around swirl the coloring with a fork once the chocolate is starting set  you can take a toothpick and cut out heart shapes they might look kind of messy  but you can clean them up once theyre removed once dry  break up the chocolate around the hearts enjoy
