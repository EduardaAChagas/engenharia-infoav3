find a copy of cinnamon girl by neil young and play it in the kitchen while you work dont crank it up  just play it in the background its optional  of course  but i think the finished product seems to come out better wrap the cinnamon stick in a clean dish towel and whack it carefully with your bowling ball you could use a rolling pin or heavy skillet  but thats boring add the cinnamon fragments to one cup of honey in a saucepan  and warm over low heat for 10 minutes let stand 34 hours  then strain into a sterilized jar store at room temperature a nice gift for honey lovers  cinnamon lovers and neil young fans
a cinnamon spiced honey that neil young probably uses on his morning toast. makes a great gift. standing time not included in estimates.
