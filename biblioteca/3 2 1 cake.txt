3 ingredients microwavable good  i found this recipe somewhere but i go to so many recipe sites i cant remember where.  this is a very easy very good very quick single serve cake  your choice of flavors.  i prefer chocolate  the 321 comes from 3 tablespoons cake mix 2 tablespoons water and 1 minute in the microwave.  you can make it a little bigger by adding more cake mix and a little more water to cake battter consistency.  i made this for the hubby and he loved it  going to try other flavor cake mixes with it too.  made the chocolate cake and topped it with sliced sugared strawberries  whipped cream ice cream and toppings even icing would be good toppers
