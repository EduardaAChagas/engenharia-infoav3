we have an abundance of peppers of all sorts growing wonderfully in our garden so i came up with this wonderful medium heat level sauce adjustable that went great as an accompiment with our broiled cod fish fillets. use it for any recipe calling for thai chili sauce. also great as a warm drizzle over a light salad or how about over ice cream. this is also a great canning or oamc recipe  great for gift givinggift baskets. recipe doubles triples etc. quite easily just needing longer time to reduce down.
