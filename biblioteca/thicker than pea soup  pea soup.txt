throw all the ingredients into a large pot  bring to a boil  then simmer for about 2 hours  or until the peas have completely softened make sure you stir this frequently as it will have a tendency to stick to the pot add more water if gets too thick
i love soup and this soup is easily a meal in of itself.  its also a testament to the fact that meat does not need to be added to everything to make it taste great.  the beauty of this recipe is its simplicity and it tastes delicious.  it is great with some fresh white bread for dipping.
