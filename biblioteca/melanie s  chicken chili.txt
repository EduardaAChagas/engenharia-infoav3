heat a large stock pot to mediumheat with olive oil add onion and peppers season with a pinch of salt  pepper cook until softened  about 23 minutes add the chicken season with a pinch of salt and pepper cook until white  and cooked through about 34 minutes add the tomatoes  beans  garlic  and corn season with salt and pepper cook for 23 minutes add all of the spices and the adobo sauce add chicken stock you may want more or less chicken stock depending on your desired consistency i like mine fairly thick bring to a boil reduce to a rapid simmer simmer for about 3060 minutes  all up to you  the longer and lower temperature the better add corn meal and cheese to thicken a little at a time stir rapidly to avoid lumps simmer for another 15 minutes or so you may need to add more corn meal and  or cheese to obtain your desired thickness check for seasoning  you may want to add more salt and pepper to fit your taste also  add more cayenne or chili powder for heat and depth once the desired thickness and seasoning is achieved  the chili is technically ready to serve i often like to turn the heat down to low and cook longer  anywhere from 15 minutes to hours this continues to intensify the flavors and thicken the chili serve in a bowl with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro  scallions  cheddar cheese  and a spoonful of sour cream fresh corn tortillas  cornbread  and garlicjalapeno focaccia bread go well with this also you can vary this in any way  often ill use shredded rotisserie chicken or different types of beans also  you can omit the tomatoes  adobo sauce and red powders all together and use roasted  seeded and peeled green chiles if you like more of that east coat  midwestern style chili use ground chicken or turkey and add some tomato paste instead of the cheese  cornmeal to thicken you can also omit the meat altogether and add extra beans  vegetables this recipe also works well in the crock pot left cooking all day using dried  soaked beans  i like the health benefits of this myself
years ago i started experimenting with a chicken variety of my moms old basic chili recipe.    i never ever make a chili the same way  thats the beauty of it.   just use what you have in your pantry or what you are craving....theres really no way you can go wrong.   every time i make chili with chicken it is different. for my family  friends who think there is an actual melanies chicken chili recipe heres my attempt to finally publish it with approximate ingredients for you.    feel free to mix it up anyway you please  but my biggest rule is please dont use canned diced chilies in that acidic gross tasting preservative juice  yeah you know what im talking about and gross
