we grew up with this casserole that we called goulash. it is an humble dish that is comforting with its blend of garlic mushrooms peppers and bacon. the oregano gives it a special flavor that makes it different from other hamburger casseroles. the original version did not have a bread crumb topping but it does jazz it up for company. if you are lucky enough to have some frozen cooked ground beef oamc this recipe can be assembled much quicker.this doubles nicely.
