spread whipped butter on sourdough bread pat the butter side in the grated parmesan cheese place both bread pieces in a skillet or on a griddle put 1 slice of swiss and provolone on 1 slice of bread and 1 slice of mozzarella and cheddar on the other cook until parmesan it toasted place sandwich slices together and enjoy 
if you like grilled cheese sandwiches you will love this one also you can put other items with it such as ham bacon turkey... also try it on a cold winter day with tomato soup. if you cant find sourdough bread use thick sliced bread. also i add granulated garlic to the whipped butter to add a little kick.
