a variant on the theme in the swiss canton of nidwalden  aelplermagrone is prepared with equal amounts of macaroni and potatoes dried apple slices are traditionally served as a side dish bring the milk and one tablespoon of salt to a boil add the noodles  reduce the heat  and cook over a low heat until done  stirring occasionally the noodles should absorb enough milk so that the dish is still moist while the pasta is cooking gently saute the onions in butter  and garlic cloves  keeps it low and slow so as not to burn the onion or garlic  which would make it bitter empty the noodles into a preheated bowl mix in cheese and pepper top with onions which have been sauteed in butter  and garlic cloves the aelplermagrone can be served at this point often a green salad is served alongside but if you prefer  you can also turn the mixture into a casserole and bake it in the oven long enough to brown the top nicely  usually about twenty minutes at 400 f  200 c
lplermagronethe name doesnt translate perfectly into english. magrone is of course macaroni but lpler doesnt only refer to the mountains and the people who live there but more specifically to the men who would go up into the high pastures with the cows every summer. they had plenty of milk and cheese available to make this rich and delicious dish. this is traditionally serverd with fried onions on top and apple slices or sauce on the side. the cooking time is approximate. you can saute your onions while cooking the macaroni. a straight tubular pasta is what is commonly used penne mostaccioli or rigatoni would all work well.
