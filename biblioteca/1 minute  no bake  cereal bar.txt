my pantry is running very low on baking supplies but i had a box of raisinbran cereal that had too many raisins that i wanted to use up. so i chose to adapt my other recipe recipe 357474 using what i had on hand. i think this turned out really nice and entirely different from the original version. i used peanuthazelnut butter instead of peanut butter.
