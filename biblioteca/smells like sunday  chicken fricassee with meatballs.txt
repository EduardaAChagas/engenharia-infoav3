like many family recipes this one was created out of the need to stretch ingredients. one day when there was just a little chicken and even less ground beef in the house an old aunt of mine decreed that the two should be cooked together to make a meal large enough for the whole family. the result was a wonderfully tasty dish that smelled just like sunday dinner but it wasnt because on sundays we always made sure to have enough of either chicken or meat. this is one of my absolute favorite ways to cook chicken. i hope that you enjoy it as well.
