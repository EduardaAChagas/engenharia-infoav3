melt chocolate chips and add frosting stirring quickly  as it will set up as you stir press into buttered 8x8 pan  refrigerate for about 10 to 15 minutes before cutting into 2 inch squares
this is super quick and super easy.  it also sets up super fast so have your buttered pan prepared.  do not use imitation chocolate chips or flavored chips such as butterscotch or peanut butter since these do not work as well.   i have found however the off brand cheap frostings work best.
