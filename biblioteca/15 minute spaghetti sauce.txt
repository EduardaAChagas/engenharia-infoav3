i was stretched for time so wanted something easy  fast for dinner this recipe was the result.  very tasty. i dont usually buy precooked hamburger but had this one on hand to try and for an emergency it is quite good. i wont even look at what prservatives may be in it. make this as hot or as mild as you want.  i like to sprinkle parmesan chees ovr it at the table.  nice served with a green salad and a crusty roll
