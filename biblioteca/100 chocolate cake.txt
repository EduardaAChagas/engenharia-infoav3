mix all cake ingredients till well blended bake in 2 greased round cake pans in 350f oven for 30 minutes cool  while cake cools completely mix filling and spread between cooled cake rounds and frost with grandmas fudge frosting must refrigerate if serve with pudding filling prep time does not include cooling time
the mayonnaise in this may sound strange but it it the secret ingredient that makes the cake so moist. i recommend not using miracle whip as it contains spices and flavorings that might alter the taste. they make great cupcakes too.
