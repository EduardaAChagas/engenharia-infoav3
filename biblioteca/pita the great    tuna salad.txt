i found this recipe in the looney spoons cookbook and it has become a family favourite. there are a few more ingredients than your standard tuna salad but it is well worth the extra time. an equivalent amount of chopped cooked chicken breast may be substituted for the tuna with equally delicious results. my 9 yo dd especially loves these so i send the components in her school lunch and she assembles it when shes ready to eat. i hope you enjoy
