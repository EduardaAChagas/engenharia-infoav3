this recipe came from the back of a nestle cocoa can. ive been making these for years and theyre always a hit. the batter is pretty thick which makes them very fudgy. the original recipe included frosting but i think it makes them too rich. if you have a strong sweet tooth you might like them with the frosting. the frosting recipe is posted separately. enjoy
