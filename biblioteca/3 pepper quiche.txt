this was adapted from a recipe i found on the net but i added julienne onion to the peppers.  this is a meal in itself or you could have a small slice with a meat dish.  for those that like to have brunch its a bit different to your traditional quiche recipes.  if you love cheese you could add 12 cup of your favorite to the egg mixture then pour over peppers.
