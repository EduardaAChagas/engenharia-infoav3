heat oil over mediumhigh heat in large frying pan that has a lid season pork chops with salt and pepper sear chops in pan till lightly browned  about 12 minutes per side remove frying pan from burner slowly pour can of stewed tomatoes over chops distribute tomatoes so some are under chops and the balance is evenly covering the tops of the pork chops cover pan and return to burner reduce heat to low and simmer for 23 hours  or until chops are fork tender you can leave the chops on low for even longer  if you prefer  adjust to your schedule uncover and let simmer for another hour until some of the water in the pan evaporates serve with side of mashed potatoes or over pasta of your choice with some parmesan cheese
you will not believe how good these pork chops are after seeing how easy they are to make.  these are so simple yet worthy of serving to company.  i get rave reviews every time i serve them and im always asked for the recipe yet almost embarrased to give it  the trick is to cook slowly with enough heat but not so much that the chops are boiling to get tough and dry. and the cooking time is very flexible...you can simmer these for up to 6 hours if youd like.  by the way i consider the salt and pepper freebies in the ingredient count
