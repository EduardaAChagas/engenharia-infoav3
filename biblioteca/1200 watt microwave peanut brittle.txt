line a baking  cookie sheet with foil or parchment paper and spray with cooking spray or grease with butter put 1 tablespoon molasses in a cup measuring cup and then fill with corn syrup put corn syrup mixture and white sugar in an eight cup bowl and mix well then microwave on high for 2 minutes  remove and stir and then microwave for 1 more minute remove from microwave and add peanuts  stir into bubbling sugar mixture and microwave for 2 minutes remove from microwave and then stir in butter and vanilla and microwave for 1 minute remove from microwave and quickly stir in baking soda  it will get somewhat white and foamy  spread out onto baking sheet  you can let it cool at room temperature or cool in the fridge put mixing bowl cup in sink under hot running water to aid in cleanup i add the molasses because it gives the brittle a beautiful color  it is not required to make the recipe  if you dont want to use it  just use a full cup of corn syrup watch out with sampling  this stuff is habit forming  if you want to bump it up a notch  add 1 teaspoon cinnamon to sugars at begining or if you really want to kick up it up  add the cinnamon and 1  3 teaspoon caynne pepper  hot stuff i love the sweet and spicy
bravo to love2eats peanut brittle in a jiffy 58383  it got me started but with the adjustments for my higher powered microwave  and some flavor changes i thought i should write my own recipe.  i can not say how much love2eats note about having everything measured out and ready to go was a life saver.  i use an 8 cup pyrex measuring bowl with a handle as this mixture bubbles up and gets very hot bowl gets very hot too  it is molten sugar if your work area is not right next to your sink  have a bowl of ice water in case  of burns. this recipe is for a 1200 watt microwave.  oh yeah i sorta faked it on how many this will serve  it is habit forming.
