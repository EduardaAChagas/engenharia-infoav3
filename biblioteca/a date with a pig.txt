take the bacon and cut it in half wrap each individual date in the 1  2 slice of raw bacon secure each bacon wrapped date with a toothpick place all of these dates on a cookie sheet cook at 350 for approximately 30 minutes  turning them once they are done when all sides are brown remove toothpicks before serving these are easily transported and reheated serve warm and wait for the applause 
this has got to be the easiest appetizer in the world   it has 2 ingredients and anyone who has tried these just loves them  my plate always comes home empty....so enjoy
