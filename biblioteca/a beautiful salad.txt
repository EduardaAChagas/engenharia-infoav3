simply put all ingredients except the nuts  into a large salad bowl toss with vinaigrette serve and enjoy  i do not add the nuts to the salad  but serve them separately at the table to avoid their becoming less then crisp
this is a beautiful salad indeed with a scrumptious taste. a perfect blend of many flavors.
baby spinach leaves red onion mandarin oranges dried cranberries sliced almonds feta cheese balsamic vinaigrette
