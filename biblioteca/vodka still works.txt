place the bitters in a tall glass and combine them with vodka using a cocktail spoon add ice to the glass then fill it with ginger beer and stir again serve with a straw
these are billed as a great alternative to a bloody mary especially for brunches.  i saw them served on rr  and am looking forward to making them  sound refreshing if you like the ingredients and are looking for fun new cocktails to serve for new years
