i found this recipe online somewhere and i cannot find it again. i am glad i wrote it down when i found it this recipe is simple to throw together and it tastes sooo good over some steamed rice. my family loved it this recipe is pretty versitle too...i am sure plenty of spices and herbs could be added to it..maybe even some onion and garlic. play with it and enjoy
