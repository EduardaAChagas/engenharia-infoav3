brown the sausage well  crumbling with a fork remove from skillet and set aside remove excess grease in a large skillet  heat olive oil add onion and cook to desired tenderness add mushrooms and garlic and cook 34 minutes add peppers and cook to desired tenderness when the veggies are at your desired tenderness  add the red wine vinegar and sugar if using sausage  add the meat back to the skillet if i am using fresh basil  i add it last however  if i am using dried basil  i add it with the mushrooms pour all contents over al dente penne pasta i like to top with grated parmesan cheese
this is a family favorite.  i modified this recipe from an old roommate in college.  she would make a vegetarian version without italian sausage.  it was also wonderful.  hope you enjoy
