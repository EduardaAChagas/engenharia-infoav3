while trying to come up with a satisfying snack or dessert that fit the requirements of my low carb low calorie low fat diet ugh but im only on it for 3 weeks as a jumpstart i invented this. ive experimented often with doityourself coffee mixes and i think this is better than most.  im mostly putting this here to calculate the nutritional information.for cocoa use the best you can find.  currently im using ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa from a 10 oz. can sold in the baking section of publix.  my current sweetener is sucaryl tablets from canada and i use 2 tablets easy to rememberthats why i tried these proportions.edit after publishing when i found out the total carb count and realized it was too high due to the milk powder i decided to wait until i go back to lowcarbing and then use cream which has zero carbs.  however this is still quite low in calories so many dieters should find it useful.
