i had the privilege to be introduced to the legendary upstate new york gastronomic delight the spiedie  while visiting binghamton ny. ive long ago used the last of the terrific lupos marinade i brought back to australia with me. i searched for years to find a similar recipe and have tried many. this one was posted on a web forum and claimed to be the authentic recipe from someone who used to work there. ive adjusted it slightly and think its pretty close. this is my favorite football sunday lunch.
