yes this cake is made with beets and you wont believe how great it is. i got the recipe from a friend who said it is the most requested cake in her family. even the kids want it for their birthday cake. i baked it for one of our family gatherings and now i get lots of requests for it too. the batter looks red but the red bakes out. i use an almond flavored frosting on it sometimes. other times i just serve it with homemade whipped cream.
