core the apples  but it isnt necessary to peel them i like the texture of having the peels in the sauce dice them very fine tumble everything into a large pot and bring to a boil reduce to the slowest simmer you can arrange on your stove so the sauce wont burn on the bottom of the pot cover  stirring occasionally  until you reach the consistency you want the longer  the finer texture i usually cook it about 3 hours
cinnamonophiles will love this one. try it on french toast.
