i decided to make my own version of the orange coloured soup using an amalgamation of recipes. it is nice and sweet and yummy. and easy eat as an appetizer or make a meal out of it by adding about 0.5 cup of red lentils cook them first before you cook the vegetables and serve with warm bread or buns.
