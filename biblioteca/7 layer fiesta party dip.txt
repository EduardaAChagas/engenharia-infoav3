in a bowl mix together the refried beans  half of the package of taco seasoning  the salsa  and 3 tablespoons of the sour cream spread the mixture into a large rectangular glass lasagna dish in a separate bowl mix the rest of the sour cream with the remaining taco seasoning spread the sour cream mixture on top of the refried beans taking your guacamole  spread it carefully on top of the sour cream mixture take care not to mix the two together toss the two types of grated cheese together  then spread them on top of the guacamole sprinkle with the tomatoes  olives  and green onions chill in refrigerator for at least an hour before serving you can make this recipe a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge overnight  let it come to room temperature before serving with round  restaurantstyle tortilla chips some folks like to serve this hot instead of cold bake at 350 degrees f for 30 minutes  if youd like to do that when i make it these days  i usually fiddle with it a bit  by using 1 can of black bean refried beans instead of regular  adding ancho powder into the beans and sour cream  and adding a small can of chopped mild green chiles into the refried beans when im lucky enough to bring home any of this from a party as leftovers  i fill flour tortillas with the dip and fry them up as burritos theyre wonderful both warm and cold  and taste great for lunch 
this recipe was very popular back in my teenaged castparty days when my mom would make it for us.  i recall getting the recipe from mike everhearts mom i think. i love this stuff i usually make a double or 1.5 recipe and keep the extras at home for myself.    its hard to believe how much folks are paying for these layered dips in the stores... it tastes better when you make your own
