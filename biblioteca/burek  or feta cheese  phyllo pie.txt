first  let me explain the feta we have an italian market that sells fresh fruits and veggies etc and they have a fresh cheese section i always buy a block of french feta cheese i use half for this recipe and the rest for omelets etc you can use the prepacked feta but if you want the full experience youll need a lot also  you may use other variety of feta the french is very salty which is why i add cottage cheese it kind of balances out the saltiness abit you just need 1 package of phyllo mine says 32 oz  buy the long box not the country preheat oven to 350f in large mixing bowl beat eggs  add 2 cups milk and mix well take your block of feta and cut in half use one 1  2 and refrigerate the other crumble the feta into the egg mix and add cottage cheese make sure you have nice chunks mix well  the mixture should be thick and very lumpy if too thick add more milk take a large deep baking dish sprinkle oil on bottom only lay one sheet phyllo and drizzle with oil  continue until you have 4 sheets when you add the last sheet place your hand flat on the phyllo sheets and gently gather  without tearing by pulling the sides slightly toward center  use 1 full ladle of the egg  feta mixture onto the layer  you dont need to cover all the phyllo just dont leave the feta in one spot distribute layer another phyllo sheet and sprinkle with oil layer another sheet of phyllo and again crumple the center then sprinkle the oil one ladle of the egg  feta mix continue in this pattern if you see that you have alot of the egg  feta mix left you can start to add more than the 1 ladle your last layer should be 34 layers of phyllo dont sprinkle with oil yet take a soup spoon and with the handle  tuck in the sides now sprinkle with oil bake for about 3040 minutes or until the top is puffed and nicely browned your kitchen with smell wonderful the burek will puff high off the top of the pan but once cooled will drop you must cool completely or you will nto be able to cut with out it falling apart its moist and a bit salty and goes great with a nice cold beer  you can serve as main meal with salad or as appetizer
ok there are different version of burek some eastern europeans even greeks roll a fresh dough and then spend more time rolling folding and waiting. but if youre like me and my mom use phyllo its quick and you can always keep it in the freezer.  i remember while i was growing up and my mom would make this every sunday the smell alone coming from our kitchen used to make me come running home. please excuse the directions but the recipe doesnt really have measurements or written directions this is an old recipe and no one ever wrote it down.
