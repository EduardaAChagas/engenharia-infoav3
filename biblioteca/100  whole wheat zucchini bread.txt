this is a zucchini bread made only with whole wheat flour im sure you could make it 12 with whole wheat flour and 12 with all purpose. it is really easy and delicious it turns out quite sweet with 1 12 cups of sugar so if youre trying to cut back on sugar i think only 1 cup would be enough this recipe makes 2 loaves
