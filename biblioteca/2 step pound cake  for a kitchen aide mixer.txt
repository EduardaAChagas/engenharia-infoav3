this recipe was published in a southern living magazine and my sister and i love it.  you must use a kitchen aid mixer or similar stand mixer you cannot use a hand mixer or rotary bowl mixer. easy and yummy.  you can glaze with thinned apricot preserves for a little more decadence.  i have used the recipe for petit fours baked in a 10 x 15 pan with a poureddipped fondant.  this recipe always brings compliments.  prep time includes cooling.
