place margarine in a mixing bowl fluff with mixer add sugar  small amounts at a time add eggs one at a time add flour a little bit at a time alternating with the milk add the vanilla spray cake pans with pam and dust lightly with flour cake will make 4 layers if you only have 2 cake pans like me    you can bake in 2 shifts bake at 350f for 25 minutes after taking the final pans out of the oven  let cool you can begin cooking the frosting here for frosting put sugar in a 3qt sauce pan add water stir a little to dissolve sugar bring to a boil and stop stirring lower heat to medium  bring to soft ball stage  until it just begins to spin a thread while it cooks remember  do not stir the frosting while cooking the process will take about 1520 minutes meanwhile  beat egg whites until stiff pour cooked syrup into the egg whites in a thin stream while you beat it with a spoon beat for a few minutes to cool it a little add coconut and coconut flavoring when it starts to cool a little  it is ready to frost the cake wait 1015 minutes for this to occur while frosting  keep this in mind frosting tends to separate make sure that you keep the frosting homogenous while frosting frosting is very thin  so it will fall off of the cake make sure to frost on the platter that you will serve the cake on also  keep reapplying the frosting that falls off until almost all is reabsorbed fresh coconut will stick to sides and syrup will absorb into cake this is the most moist  delicious  yummy cake in the world  perfect for an anniversary or holiday 
oh my goodness  totally worth all of the work  everyone always asks for and always loves
