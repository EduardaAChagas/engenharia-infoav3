set a large pot of salted water on to boil mix all the ingredients together well  except the fat you should have a soft but moldable dough you may need to mix in a little more flour divide the dough into 4 equal parts mold into flattish  rectangular cakes  about 2 thick gently place the cakes in the boiling water and simmer for 1  2 hour drain and let cool it will fall apart if you try to slice it before it is cool cut in 1  2 thick slices and fry in bacon or ham fat  over medium heat  until nicely browned  on both sides
from the galt cookbook published in 1898. i have adapted it slightly by adding quantities and instructions. to my complete surprise these remind me a little of lo bak go dim sum popular at chinese new years. the good ladies of galt are no doubt rolling in their graves but i serve these with a good whack of chilegarlic sauce cause thats how i like my lo bak go too. these are not the sort of thing to make from scratch but from the leftovers of a hamandpotato meal. they are easiest to mix if the potatoes are still warm so set them on to poach as you clean up after dinner. then they can be fried up when you want them. keep cakes wrapped in the fridge until ready to fry. they will keep for a couple days so you dont have to fry all of them at once. i should also note that i use an unsalted smoked ham so you may wish to reduce or eliminate the salt if your ham is salted.
