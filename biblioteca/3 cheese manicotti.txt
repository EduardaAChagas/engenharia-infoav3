years ago my grandmother ordered me these recipe cards in the mail that you file in a box that the company provides. i didnt much care for the recipes so we ended the subscription. there was one gem in the bunch though. it remains a family favorite i dont remember the name of the company i have adjusted the cooking times several times based on different ovens military moving rental houses unreliable ovens so you may need to watch it and cook it more or less based on your oven. it is not a very traditional recipe but it is quick with little mess you can also make it ahead and just cook it when you are ready.
