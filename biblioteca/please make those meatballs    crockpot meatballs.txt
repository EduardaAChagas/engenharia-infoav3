put meatballs in the crockpot combine the rest of the ingredients pour soup mix over meatballs and stir cover and cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4 hours
my kids and the neighbourhood kids are always asking for me to make these...little do they know it is so easy  i put it together in the morning or even the night before and the crockpot does the rest.  i have made bigger and smaller batches...just adjust ingredients accordingly  awesome over mashed potatoes or egg noodles.
