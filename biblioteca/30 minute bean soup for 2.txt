cooking for 2 is such a challenge we love dried beans but cooking a small amount doesnt seem worth the effort and we arent keen on leftovers. this is something i came up with to mimic a hearty bean soup without all the hassle or leftovers. even drained and rinsed canned beans are not something i use often  they taste off to me. the added lemon juice brightens up the canned flavor and i suggest not leaving it out. the vegetables can be varied according to taste. omit the ham for a vegetarian meal or substitute cooked crumbled bacon for an even richer flavor.  dont like great northern beans  add the variety that pleases you.  using this recipe as a guide follow your tastebuds.
