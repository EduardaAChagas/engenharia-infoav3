this chicken tortilla soup is a recipe that i came up with when i got tired of seeing all of the others that have you mix in packets of seasoning and really they turn our way too spicy to enjoy or theyre so bland you dont want to eat them. this is something my husband loves and he never liked tortilla soup before. great on a cold day and even better when you get the craving. this is a healthy recipe thats nothing but homemade.
