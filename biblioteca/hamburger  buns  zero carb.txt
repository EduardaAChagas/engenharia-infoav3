preheat oven to 350 degrees separate your eggs making sure there is absolutely no yolk in the white mixture in a small bowl  mix together egg yolks  cottage cheese  and sweetener until creamy in a larger bowl  add egg whites and cream of tartar and beat the whites with an electric mixer on high until fluffy you want this mixture to be well whipped and quite stiff  under mixing will result in a very runny mixture carefully fold egg yolk mixture into the egg whites with a large spatula  until evenly mixed try not to overmix  you dont want to loose the fluffiness of the egg whites mixture spray two cookie sheets with pam with a large spoon scoop the mixture into 10 even rounds on the sheets place cookie sheet the middle rack and set timer for 20 minutes now you will need to watch them  because the cooking time may vary on any two batches basically  you want them to bake until they become nice and golden brown color remove from the pans and cool on a wire rack
these mock hamburger buns are amazingly breadlike in texture and taste and are suitable for all phases of the dukan diet once completely cool seal them in a ziplock storage baggie or a tupperware over night. they will totally change their consistency to something much more like bread  a softer texture that is nice and chewy. while warm they are crumbly and similar to cooked meringue  but dont let this fool you since the sides that were facing the pan are perfectly flat you use these to spread things on or make sandwiches or even as a burger bun my favorite is spreading cream cheese on both sides like a sandwich and stuffing with a freshly poached egg...delish
