beat eggs until light beat in sugar and salt add the vanilla mix in the melted butter add the cocoa and flour using the low speed on mixer pour into a microwave safe dish microwave on high for 3 to 5 minutes on a turntable  preferably do not let the center get totally dry or it will be overcooked i took mine out when there was just a small moist spot in the center  but next time i will probably let it bake for maybe 10 seconds less it finishes cooking as it cools you can frost if you like  but i prefer my brownies unfrosted
