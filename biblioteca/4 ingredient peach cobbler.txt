in a mixing bowl  combine flour  sugar  and butter with a pastry cutter until it forms crumbles about half the size of a pea pour the can of peaches into your baking pan and sprinkle flour mixture evenly over the top this recipe does take about 45 minutes to bake  just keep watch for the juices to start bubbling and the top to brown bake at 350 sorry i forgot to add that in 
my motherinlaw makes this recipe and it is the most wonderful peach cobbler i have ever tasted. whenever the family gets together this is what i request for dessert and there is never any left and best of all it only takes four ingredients
flour sugar butter peaches
