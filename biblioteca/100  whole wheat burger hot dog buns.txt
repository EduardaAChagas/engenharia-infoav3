i found a recipe on the internet and substituted and added different ingredients to make a white hamburger bun recipe 100 whole wheat and healthy. i have been making them for years and my family and friends just love these buns never will i buy buns again as with any bread machine recipe add flour andor water as needed. you can add other ingredients such as dried onion flakes ground flax seed or whatever. sometimes after cooling i wrap and freeze them and defrost as needed. i hope you will love this recipe as much as i do also this recipe also makes great dinner rolls. just divide dough into 12 to 24 balls depending on the size of roll you want.
