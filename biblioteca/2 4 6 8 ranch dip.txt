toss all of the veggies and the cheese together in a medium bowl start with about a 1  4 cup of ranch dressing and stir continue to add ranch until it is all well covered serve with your favorite cracker
2 green peppers 4 tomatoes 6 green onions and 8 oz. of mozzarella all covered in ranch and served on a cracker  yum  my dear friend annette introduced this to us.  its an easy appetizer that tastes great.  i have not made it myself yet so i am unsure how much ranch to use.  just add a little at a time until it reaches a good consistency.  once i make it i will add an exact amount it should be easy to figure out. we love it.
