this recipe from karin calloway of the augusta chronicle eliminates many of the steps in creating traditional lasagna.  instead of the cheese mixture and noodles you use cheese ravioli.  you layer the ravioli with meat sauce and mozzarella cheese and bake.  voila   its not lasagna and it is delicious and perfect for a weeknight supper.
