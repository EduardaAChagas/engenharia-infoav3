this is not your usual macaroni salad....there is no miracle whip in this. when i first saw it i was a little put off because of the looks of it but was sooo surprised when i tasted itglad i did tasty  a nice change.i put 1 day for cook time as this is best made ahead of timei am guessing on servings also as it depends on the appetites and the venue
