combine all ingredients in large bowl  stir til combined serve immediately or refrigerate for an hour or two to let flavors mingle we especially like it on cracked wheat bread but sourdough or croissants would be delicious as well
i tried a pork chop recipe for dinner that my family didnt enjoy.  i had a lot of chops leftover that i didnt want to waste so i put them in the fridge til the next day hoping to figure out what to do with them.  my family loves chicken salad sandwiches  the idea came to me that i should try to disquise the pork chops by making them into chicken salad.  this is the delicious result minus the original pork chop preparation.  i used what i had on hand at the time but most of the ingredients are easily substituted  now i will just use any leftover pork chops for this.  it tastes just like my chicken salad.
