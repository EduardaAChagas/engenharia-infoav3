these dont even have one gram of fat if prepared with the listed ingredients  if you prefer a sweeter taste add in some spenda sweetener. in place of the freezer pop plastic molds use 18 3ounce disposable clear plastic drink cups with 18 wooden sticks. to make removing the freezer pops easier from the plastic cup just run under warm water and it will pop out.
