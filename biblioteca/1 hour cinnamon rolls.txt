usually this recipe takes me a little more than an hour to make but it still is a quick way to make cinnamon rolls for a great morning breakfast surprise.  ive been making these rolls for my family for 18 years.  it can be made as cinnamon rolls or caramel sticky buns by changing the filling and the icing. if you have a mixer capable of kneading you can cut the kneading time to about 4 minutes just until dough comes together well and begins to pull from the sides.
