these are some of the best dinner rolls ive made the recipe came from a cookbook that my hometown puts out called high altitude country kitched vol.1 oct.1995 thru july 1999. this recipe can give you homemade rolls in just 60 minutes what could be better than freshly baked hot rolls to compliment a dinner these are wonderful hot right out of the oven or cold the next day for sandwiches hope you enjoy them as much as i do
