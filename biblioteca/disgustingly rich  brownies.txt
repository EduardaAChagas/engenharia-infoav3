preheat over to 350f first  mix cocoa and sugar together and pour the melted butter inches mix well add the eggs and vanilla  again mix thoroughly i add the salt now to avoid the trouble of sifting  stir in the flour until just combined bake in a greased 8 or 9 inch pan until the brownies pull away from the sides depending on how high your batter was  it can take anywhere from 20 min to 45 the insides should still be a bit moist  which makes the brownies taste fudgy when i make a double batch  i use the same size pan and cook lower and slower so i get higher  thicker brownies wait until they cool completely before icing  or cutting
i got this particular recipe from kid cooking a very slightly messy manual kidz klutz press. its a doozy. ive had people tell me theyd go into a diabetic coma for just one more. theyre good. theyre easy.
white sugar eggs cocoa powder flour salt butter vanilla extract walnuts soft cream cheese icing sugar
