this first part is best made ahead to allow for cooling in a small sauce pan  mix flour into milk  then heat on low heat  stirring constantly until mixture resembles a thick pudding cover and let cool in a separate bowl  cream butter with sugar add vanilla and blend until smooth add first mixture after fully cooled decorate as usual should be able to ice one 8x8 cake excellent for carrot cake when using cream cheese
dont know where this recipe originated just that its been around my family for a long time.  a very different method of making an icing however if you dont like the traditional powdered sugar ones this is very light  doesnt taste as sweet.  it is fantastic and a little thicker when cream cheese is substituted for butter.
milk flour butter granulated sugar vanilla
