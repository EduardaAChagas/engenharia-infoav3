this recipe was adapted by my mother and myself from meat chili. we fed it to my dad and only told him afterwards it wasnt meat  he couldnt tell the difference this is a fast and filling meal and is even better cold or warm the next day i serve leftovers with tortilla chips or in a wrap. also good with sour cream andor cheese on top.
