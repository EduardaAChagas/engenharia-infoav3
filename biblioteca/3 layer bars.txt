first layer  mix all ingredients together to form a crumbly mixture press into the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan  pressing firmly place pan in the freezer to set while preparing the next layer second layer  mix the first three ingredients together  using enough milk to make a stiff  frostinglike consistency if desired  add a drop of yellow food coloring do not add too much milk  you want the mixture to be pretty stiff  but still spreadable remove the pan from the freezer and scrape the second layer onto the first  spreading as evenly as possible  and then using your hands to press down to smooth return pan to freezer third layer  melt the chocolate chips together with the butter you can use a double boiler  but i have had good luck using a small saucepan and very low heat  with stirring remove the pan from the freezer pour the melted chocolate mixture over the second layer working quickly  spread the chocolate layer evenly return the pan to the freezer for no more than a few minutes you want the chocolate to begin to set before you cut the bars but if you wait too long  the chocolate will be too hard and you wont be able to cut through it without it breaking the point at which the chocolate loses its shine and takes on a dull appearance is the right time to remove the pan from the freezer and cut into small squares after cutting  return to the freezer to harden completely  then remove from the pan store in the refrigerator
my mom got this recipe 30 years ago from a friend of hers who was from australia.  i dont know if this is an australian dessert i have heard that it is similar to a canadian dessert called nanaimo bars though.  this is a christmas tradition in my family but is wonderful anytime
