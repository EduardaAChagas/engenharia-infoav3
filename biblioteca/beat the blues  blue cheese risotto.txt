nb i like to use a fairly strong flavoured  but creamy blue cheese  like gorgonzola  but stilton is also nice stockwise  you may need a little more or less than in the ingredients list bring stock up to a simmer halve the leeks and remove any gritty bits from inside the rings cut the leek into fine strips rather than semicircles  of approx 12 inches in length melt half the butter with the olive oil and cook the leeks for approx 10 minutes over a lowmedium heat until soft and tinged with brown add bacon to pan and cook for about 5 minutes stir in garlic and rice  cook for a further minute or two  stirring the rice until its coated in the butter and oil and starts to go slightly translucent add the wine to the pan  turning up the heat to bubble most of it away add a ladleful of hot stock to the leek and rice mixture at a time  stirring more or less constantly add more stock each time that most of the liquid has been absorbed add the fresh sage keep doing this for approximately 15  25 minutes  until the risotto is creamy  but the rice grains still have a slight bite youll need to start testing the rice after about 15 minutes  but it may take a little longer turn off the heat stir in the lemon juice  zest  remaining butter  parmesan and blue cheese leave the risotto for another 2 minutes until rich  creamy and luscious season to taste with black pepper and salt if needed
