this is an awesome reuben that uses a unique cole slaw rather than saurkraut. this is a wonderful taste sensation for reuben lovers. we think you will be as amazed as we were. we tagged recipe 260415 in the make it healthier game and did just that. we revised it to an openfaced sandwich and brought down the calories from 837 the fat from 50.5 and the carbs down from 52g. thanks chef 382123 for such a great perk to an old favorite.
