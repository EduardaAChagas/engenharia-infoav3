using zucchini was always a challenge at hom in pa dutch country. this delightful dessert pie has a tropical flair  dont let the ingredient list scare you away. i have served this to people who dont like squash and they never know if you dont tell them.  if using zucchini squash peel the green first for the best disguise.
