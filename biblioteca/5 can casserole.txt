i adopted this recipe from the recipezaar account in february 2005. the next time i try it i am going to try a smaller can of milk and try adding a 10 ounce package of frozen mixed vegetable.  if i like it that way they will become an optional ingredient.  i have added can sizes since the original recipe did not specify sizes.  the casserole was soupy which was not bad but i want to see how it is with the smaller amount of milk.
