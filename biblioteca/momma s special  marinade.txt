depending on how much meat i have i usually have to either double or triple this recipe the longer your meat marinates the better it tastes this recipe was originally for salmon  but i think it can be used universally ive also used this same recipe for steak and chicken it is wonderful

lemon juice oil worcestershire sauce basil soy sauce garlic powder pepper
