combine everything except weiners and simmer until thickdo not brown meat first i suggest using a potato masher to mix everything grind the weiners and add to pot stir and cook on low for a few hours to let all the flavors soak into meat if you want you can place sauce in a crock pot in morning and will be ready that evening the longer it cooks the better it is  serve over hot dogs on buns and enjoy
