wonderful chicken salad for a hot summer day but a great taste any time of year.  a nice change from the usual.  the lemon adds a refreshing taste along with the cucumber.my family loves this one.  i prefer to use chicken breast from a rotissere chicken.  also for the cucumber we really like the taste of the english or burplessseedless cucumber.  they are the ones wrapped individually in sealed plastic wrap in the produce dept. beside the regular cucumbers.
