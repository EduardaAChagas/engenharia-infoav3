for a very quick pick me up that is healthy and sweet. this can be transported easy for lunches breakfast and even used as a dessert for dinner with a side of ice cream. this recipe took no time at all and was ready for the table taste testing within 30 minutes. the remainders were used for breakfast in the car the next day. you can adjust the sugars to your liking. these picker uppers are not overly sweet from sugar yet you can taste the sweetness in each bite from the apples and carrots. enjoy  a huge thank you to kittencal for her crescent roll recipe.       a special note to those that mentioned the honey directions missing in the recipe. rsc 13. thank you
