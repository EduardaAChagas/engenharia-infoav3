you wont need a heavy saucepan mason jar pectin or paraffin to make these flavorful jams.  packed with chunks of fruit theyre a snap to make 0 with a little help from your microwave.  although these quick jams are made in small quantities the mixture does bubble up in the microwave so be sure to use a 6cup bowl.  also remember that doubling or tripling a microwave recipe changes the cooking time significantly.  once youve whipped up some jam transfer it to a covered small container..  refrigerated it will keep for several weeks.
