i recently tried a russian honey cake which was one of the yummiest cakes i have ever tasted. it was so nice i decided to find the recipe and learn to make it myself. it took me about 6 months searching the net on websites mostly in russian which i definitely dont read or speak translating from russian using an online translator and trying different recipes before i found this recipe which has produced a result at least as nice as the one i tried.i baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.the cream filling and coating is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar by intuition i think youre supposed to keep adding more until it thickens but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweeti have also made the fillingcoating using fresh cream  750ml soured with 12 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken you still use the sugar  honey. this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste but a very nice variation.i personally dont like walnuts all that much so i leave them out whenever i cook this.
