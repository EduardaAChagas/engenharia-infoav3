in a medium bowl  mix bisquik  applesauce and water add cinnamon if desired be sure to add liquids slowly to adjust for desired thick  thinness do not make it too thin or pancakes will not set spray skillet with nonstick spray  set over high heat to test for appropriate heat before cooking splash a few droplets of water on skillet if water splatters across the skillet  it is ready it is important to get the pan hot before you cook or pancakes wont brown properly when ready  pour in batter  about 3 tbsp full each for smaller pancakes  or according to personal preference wait about 1 minute  or until bubbles set  before flipping dont flip too many times or your pancakes will be flat  serve immediately  or if not  leave to cool on paper towels and freeze for longer storage
easy to prepare relatively diet friendly too can easily be doubled. i came up with this recipe while experimenting with bisquik. can also be cooked with heart smart bisquik.
