a perfect summer meal.  what i love about this recipe is the practicality it is both quick to make and can wait for you theres no hurry to serve.  its also a satisfying vegetarian meal that even carnivores love or if a member of your household prefers meat a chicken breast poached in water wine and paprika and then sliced very thin can be added.  i do highly recommend the garnish i devised it can be made very quickly while the couscous is cooking.  or even if you just zest a navel orange over this dish the aroma is heavenly and it brings the flavors together.  enjoy
