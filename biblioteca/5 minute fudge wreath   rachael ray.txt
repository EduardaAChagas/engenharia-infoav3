i got this recipe watching the oprah winfrey show with rachel ray.  this was a big hit with everyone  this is the recipe that everyone loves so much  i have 2 other variations also listed so that you can try them also.  when i make this recipe i am not much of a measurer i get 2 small bags of chips and just pour both in.  i will use chocolate peanut butter white chocolate or butterscotch.  i will use just one kind or mix them up.  i found its easier and just as good
semisweet chocolate chips butterscotch chips sweetened condensed milk pure vanilla extract walnuts raisins green cherries
