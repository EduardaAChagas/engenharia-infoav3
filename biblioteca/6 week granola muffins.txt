omg i went to my grandmas yesterday shes a wonderful cook and baker and she dug out this oooooooold recipe for these muffins... we went to the store to pick the ingredients up and then we stirred up a batch and baked a dozen of them they are heavenly this makes a large batch but the awesome thing is that the batter can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 6 wks so you can have fresh baked muffins whenever you feel like it with hardly any fuss at all yay
