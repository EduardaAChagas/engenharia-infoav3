you see chicken fingers and cow steak  fingers so i thought why not pig pork fingers  i changed my fried pork chop recipe and came up with this.  feel free to sprinkle more pepper and seasoning salt before frying.  this is really easier than it looks. if you want to use these as an appetizer cut the 12 pieces in half to make 24.  posted september 17th 2005.
