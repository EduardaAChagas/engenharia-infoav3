i used to call these hanky pankies why is beyond me.  after i made them at my super bowl party the first time the bears won many years ago its been a tradition every super bowl since.  7507...note these are supposed to be served hot and kept warm if possible.  during the holidays i make a double batch and freeze them in large ziplock bags with layers of wax paper or foil between each layer.  then you have a nofuss appetizer when people pop by that you dont have to pry apart when you only want to bake a portion of them
