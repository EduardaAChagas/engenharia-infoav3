this soup is wonderful  dont skip the basil pistou  never had one before but it makes the soup heavenly and different from any other bean soup ive ever had. for the second day lunch  i just had the soup added the pistou to the tupperware container  heated it up in the microwave at work  the smell was wonderful and the taste  yum i changed the original recipe from the healthy slow cooker to adjust to what i had on hand. my version is listed here  the original version was very similar but used larger amounts of ingredients  and i used what i had on hand.
