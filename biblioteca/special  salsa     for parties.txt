mix salsa and cream cheese until desired consistency sprinkle with cheese microwave until cheese has melted you may either mix it in to the salsa and cream cheese  or just keep in on top to dip through you can also stick this in the fridge and chill  then sprinkle with cheese  for a cool yet spicy alternative 
a true indigo original this is a creamy dip we started enjoying in our sheltered dorm days when the going was tough and the cooking implements even tougher.  now that im finally out in the real world with a real kitchen yipppeeeee i like making it when i need something salty and spicy to munch on...  great with tortilla chips hot or cold  have a special salsa party by invite only
