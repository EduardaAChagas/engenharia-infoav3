in a large bowl  combine lime juice  garlic and white vinegar allow the 3 ingredients to sit and marry for at least 10 minutes add in water  fish sauce  sugar and chili sauce mix well  adding either more sugar or water to adjust the taste this can be used immediately  but is definitely more flavorful when refrigerated overnight  and much much tastier once its been in the fridge for a week
i got this recipe from my mom born and raised in vietnam who was passed this recipe from my grandmother.  there are many different ways to make this dipping sauce nuoc cham and most recipes differ from family to family.  i have yet to find one as good as my own familys.  it has the sweet the sour and the spicy.  please note that this recipe makes quite a lot but it keeps very well in the fridge a few months at least.   my mother stores it in a clean 2 liter pop bottle but i usually use a large mason jar.this recipe is typically used to dip either spring rolls or fresh salad rolls in vietnam.  it can also be used as a great salad dressing for rice noodle salads.
