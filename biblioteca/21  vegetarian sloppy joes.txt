just because i dont eat meat doesnt mean i dont miss certain thingsespecially certain comfort foods. this is one of those foods. ive even impressed a few selfproclaimed carnivores with these. the avocados are optional but they really do add to the whole...ummm... sandwich experience wow that sounds kinda lame. anyway i suppose you could use actual ground beef to make these but i cannot vouch for that version of this recipe. prepcooking times are estimated.
