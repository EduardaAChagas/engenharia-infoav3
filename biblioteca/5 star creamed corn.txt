served at the 5 star pieros italian restaurant in las vegas  this is the original recipe for the most delicious creamed corn not sweet youll ever taste.  given to me by the kind executive chef of pieros las vegas.the recipe is so incredibly simple but the taste is out of this world.  not at all sticky sweet or mushy like canned cream corn rather barely sweet but just enough to make you know you are eating something very special.  you cant go wrong with this dish.super simple elegant and impressive.
