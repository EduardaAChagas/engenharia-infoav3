this is a very versatile marinade and is especially nice used with the many different cuts of beef. used as a basic marinade for meat it can be so easily adapted to be used with lamb or pork eg. add chopped fresh mint and perhaps some honey if using with lamb or grated fresh ginger if using with pork.
