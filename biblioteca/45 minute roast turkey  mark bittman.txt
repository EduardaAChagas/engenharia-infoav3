heat the oven to 450f put the turkey on a stable cutting board  breast side down  and cut out the backbone turn the bird over and press on it to flatten put it breast side up in a roasting pan that will accommodate it the wings should partially cover the breasts  and the legs should protrude a bit tuck the garlic and the herb under the bird and in the nooks of the wings and legs drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper roast for 20 minutes  undisturbed by this time the bird should be browning remove it from the oven  baste with the pan juices  and return it to the oven reduce the heat to 400f begin to check the birds temperature about 15 minutes later it is done when the thigh meat measures 155165f on an instantread meat thermometer check it in a couple of places let the bird rest for a few minutes before carving  then serve with the garlic cloves and pan juices or serve at room temperature
another great recipe from mark bittman.  its almost a given that time and oven space are at a premium on thanksgiving day and this method of roasting turkey unorthodox as it is addresses both. split flattened and roasted at 450f lowering the heat if the bird browns too fast a 10pound bird will be done in about 40 minutes. really. it will also be more evenly browned all of the skin is exposed to the heat more evenly cooked the legs are more exposed the wings shield the breasts and moister than birds cooked conventionally. but it works only for relatively small turkeys.
