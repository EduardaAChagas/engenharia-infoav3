i developed this recipe after seeing one that was similar but did not have tomatoes scallions and green pepper in it.  my husband normally does not like feta cheese very much but really liked the tang it gave this dish.  the dish is as colorful and eyepleasing as it is tasty.  i hope you enjoy this
