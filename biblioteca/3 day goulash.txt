i sort of invented this goulash with the help of my wife. i was trying to make a goulash like my mom served to all of the younguns...and i was one of them. i enjoy eating it and after eating a couple of bowls there is enough left to put in the refrigerator to warm up and enjoy again for the next 2 days. sure hope you try it...and that you like it as much as i do.
