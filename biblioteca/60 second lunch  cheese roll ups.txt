youve got mere moments between soccer practice and a music lesson or a trip to the climbing gym or a committee meeting.  sound familiar  we keep whole wheat tortillas and pollyo mozzarella sticks in the house at all times for this staple.  i like some salsa or sour cream on top but my boys like em plain.  if you make five or more at a time rearrange them at 30second intervals to melt evenly.  youre still done in about two minutes.
