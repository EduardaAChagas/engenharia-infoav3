turn the machine quickly from variable speed 1 to 10 then flip the switch to high push the ingredients down into the blades until the entire mixture is blending i find it easier to push the food continuously down one corner of the container and eventually it begins to blend the apple may require a bit of pounding before it begins to mix when the mixture is first blending it should be so thick and slushy that it is thick like a thick slushy if it is too liquid at the beginning  add more ice so it is thick and slushy this allows you to blend for 12 minutes without warming the drink up from the friction of the blades it also allows you to break the foods down to the most bioavailable level this is a beginner green smoothie that 98 of the population will love 
this is the delicious green smoothie recipe that i make and serve at my vitamix sales demonstrations.  it always wows the crowd when something that is so bright green tastes so surprisingly delicious  it is designed for a vitamix so i dont know how it would work in any other kitchen appliance.add ingredients into the 64 oz. container in the following order
green grapes banana fresh pineapple apple fresh spinach ice
