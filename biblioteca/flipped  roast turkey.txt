of all the recipes ive posted on zaar one of the most popular is recipe 98395.  for the last several years ive thought about trying the method described with a turkey but i always wimped out at the last minute.  since you only get one chance each year to do the thanksgiving feast right its a little scary to try new stuff.  this time though i was on a roll.  since everything else was coming together so well i finally decided to take a risk on the turkey.when it came out of the oven 10 people were standing in my kitchen and they sort of collectively gasped.  one of our nonfamily guests asked where did you get that turkey  and what did you do to it  it looks like something out of a magazine  to my absolute delight it tasted as good as it looked  everybody said it was the juiciest most flavorful turkey theyd ever eaten.  so yeah flipping the bird works even when its the big birdcook time is a total guess. youll need to check the temp.
