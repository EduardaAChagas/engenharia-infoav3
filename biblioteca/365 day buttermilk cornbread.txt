this cornbread is best baked in a 10inch castiron skillet but if you dont have one  a pyrex dish will do just fine if you halve this recipe  use an 8inch square dish if not  use a 9x13inch dish or pan preheat oven to 450f put the bacon drippings in your baking dish or skillet and let them melt while the oven is preheating and youre mixing up the batter beat the eggs in a medium bowl until frothy add the corn meal  salt  baking soda and baking powder  and stir to thoroughly combine add the buttermilk and stir well remove the hot pan from the oven swirl the pan to make sure it is coated with melted bacon drippings  and pour the bacon drippings into the batter stir well to combine pour the batter into the pan  and bake 20 to 25 minutes cornbread will begin to pull away from the sides of the pan as soon as the leavening ingredients are combined  the chemical action that makes the cornbread rise is sparked no need to hurry just dont mix up the batter and then make a phone call before you pop it in the oven
