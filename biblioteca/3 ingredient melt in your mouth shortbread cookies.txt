preheat oven to 350f combine all ingredients and mix for a full 10 minutes yes  i said a full 10 minutes  mixture will start out very dry and crumbly but will become batter like after the full 10 minutes i like to use my stand mixer for this  but a hand mixer will do the trick if it is a strong one drop from teaspoons or a piping bag onto a cookie sheet  i find teaspoons work best decorate with maraschino cherries or sprinkles if you feel fancy bake for approx 15 minutes or until bottoms are very lightly brown watch that the tops dont turn brown 
this is my favourite shortbread cookie and i always have the ingredients on hand. so simple to make and so delicious it produces a very delicate shortbread that is sure to please.
