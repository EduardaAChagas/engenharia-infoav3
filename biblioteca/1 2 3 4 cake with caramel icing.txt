this really a scrumptious cake though it is true as some reviewers have noted that the frosting just barely covers all three layers. you could double the recipe as some people have done or you could make a batch and a half.  your call.  to make a batch and a half the measurements would then be  34 cup butter 112 cups dark brown sugar 14  2 tablespoons milk and 3 cups of confectioners sugar.  hopefully this will give you enough frosting without having too much left over in your bowl which if youre anything like me you will then be forced to eat at least some of so as not to have to wash it all down the sink.
