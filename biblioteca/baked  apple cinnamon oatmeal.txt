this is a twist on regular oatmeal for breakfast. its quick because you bake the apples in the microwave and use instanat oatmeal.note most of y measurements are guestimates because this was the first time i made this recipe so feel free to add or subtract ingredients. this makes 2 servings but you can easy double it.
