a family staple. i am not sure how the ladies before me mom grandma et cetera... would feel about me making this recipe public but the world needs to enjoy this. this marina sauce runs through my blood. this marina sauce is the reason i needed to learn how to cook for myself... i could not live without it simply because my ladies passed away the tomatoe spelling is from my mothers handwritten recipe card where she wrote down the recipe as my grandma tina taught it to her.i will post the recipe exactly as i found it and add the little changes i made to it in parentheses. please feel free to double or triple this recipe freeze it for later to send to family or anyone else who needs a little food affection this sauce  love  excellent on pastas ravioli on pizzas for italian bread dipping... whatever else you would like to do with a delicious marina sauce
