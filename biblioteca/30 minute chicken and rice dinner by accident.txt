basically its a campbells chicken and soup recipe that i had tweaked. i had 4 hungry friends over and no real food or money since where in college this is a cheap dinner to make and easy to double good for big families. all i had on hand was chicken and rice and mushroom soup. lucky i had a few spare items on hand. i didnt like the idea of chicken just sitting there in cream of mushroom soup for an hour in the oven with rice. so i tweaked it with white wine and made it on the stovetop we couldnt wait an hour. with the brown bits it made the greyish looking soup into a pretty golden color and the garlic woke everything up. the uncle ben flavor rices are awesomewhen youre in a pinch i totally recommend them. you can also use egg noodlesit makes it a bit more richer. ever since then i get this request about twice a week and people still dont believe its cream of mushroom soupwho knew
