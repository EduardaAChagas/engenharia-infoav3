this is something my grandma made at christmas. i dont know where she originally got the recipe but the recipe card for it has her handwriting on it. i call them german carrots because grandmas grandparents came over from germany. my family mostly eats these at christmas and we usually fight over who gets the little bit thats leftover.  its a really good barbecued carrot recipe.
