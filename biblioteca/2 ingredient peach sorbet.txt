freeze the can of peaches for at least 18 hours when youre ready to make the sorbet  submerge the can in hot water for 12 minutes to loosen it up a bit in the can before opening open the can and pour the syrup into the container in which youll puree the fruit slice the frozen peaches into chunks and then add to the syrup add the lemon juice and puree until smooth enjoy immediately or you can cover and freeze for up to 8 hours 
from the can opener gourmet.  you could do this with other fruits too   the variations they use are making it with a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges and using lime juice or using a 15 oz can of tropical fruit and using 12tbsp of rum and 1 tsp of bottled citrus juice.  it all sounds tasty
