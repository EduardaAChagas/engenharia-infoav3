well being that i dont like to drink calorie filled drinks calories id much rather spend on food i always try to experiment with low calorie drinks. so one day i came up with this. tastes great add more or less coffee or equal to taste but i find this to be optimal. oh by the way the 4.5 calories is from the coffee mix.
