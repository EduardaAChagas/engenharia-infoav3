this is recipe given to me by a girlfriend which she got off a cooking show she cant remember which one but she okay it is not gourmet but it does taste pretty good and it is quick.  served with a salad and a healthy meal.  no brand of 2 minute noodles was specified but could only get zaar to accept maggi.  since found out it was james reeson one of my favourite chefs and obviously an episode i missed.
