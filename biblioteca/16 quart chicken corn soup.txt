my mom bought what she thought at the time was the biggest stockpot ever in 1998 and this is the first thing she made in it. ive always loved it and i make it when i can in my own 16 quart pot it freezes really well so dont be afraid to make it all. cook the chicken a day ahead so you can refrigerate the broth to skim the fat off easier. thanks mom
