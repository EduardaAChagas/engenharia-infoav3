cut the ham slices into about 3 pieces  removing the bone if it has one the pieces do not have to be cut even  as i usually separate around the fat  leaving some fat for flavor cured ham only place the salt cured ham slices in a large cast iron pan and add the water  enough to cover the ham slices completely the water may cook down some  so add more as you go as this removes the saltiness from the ham the more water in the pan  the better cook over med heat to a gentle simmer for about 1015 minutes until most of the salt has dissipated into the water  turning the ham a few times to shake the salt out remove ham slices and rinse and wipe the skillet with a clean dishcloth just a quick rinse  wipe to remove any salt and residue for both types of ham place pan back on stovetop at a medium heat add the oil to the pan followed by the ham slices lay them in a single layer enough to fill pan but not overcrowd them do in batches if necessary cook for about 1020 minutes depending on thickness  turning occasionally until browned drain ham onto paper towels add more oil to the pan if necessary for the next batch  although the ham will usually make its own in the pan from the previous batch you only need enough to cover the bottom of the pan eggs to a nonstick skillet  melt butter over mediumlow heat beat eggs and seasonings until very well blended when butter has melted  pour in the eggs as they begin to firm  push them around a bit using a spatula continue cooking eggs low and slow while ham is cooking in the iron skillet the ham should be done first  just place a piece of foil over top to keep warm when the eggs are about a minute from your desired doneness  place onto plates and serve with ham
heres how to turn that salt cured ham into a delicious breakfast bacon. do not use the ham slice you find in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. you can however use leftover bonein baked ham as even the smallest pieces will taste so good nibblers. a cast iron skillet works best for a true country breakfast. the eggs are optional for this recipe but if you have never slow cooked your eggs or never tried them with garlic powder its a real treat leftover ham is great to chop up and use in green beans or collard greens for dinner.
