we garlic lovers wanted to perfect recipe463221 by setting the roast chicken on a bed of 20 heads of garlic.  we were able to squeeze  luscious garlic cloves onto slices of recipe 510892 plus we divided the leftover roasted garlic to freeze to make the wonderful cooking light creamy thyme sauce whenever we so desired.  plus our 18moold granddaughter couldnt get enough of this moist and delicately seasoned chicken.  we are still working on the cooking time as the oversized chickens available in u.s. markets need a lot more additional time we added a tent of aluminum foil after the chickens skin had browned enough.  by all means use an instantread cooking thermometer.  if you saved some roasted garlic from a prior chicken you can work on the sauce while waiting for the chicken to finish roasting.  we found that if loose garlic cloves are spread in the pan they turn into charcoal briquettes it isnt necessary to cover the entire base of the pan with garlic but the chicken should rest on garlic heads.  you could fill the rest of the pan bottom with celery carrots and potatoes to roast along with the chicken.
