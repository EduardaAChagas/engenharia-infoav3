preheat oven to 360f steam your vegetables  reserve the juice cut them into big bite size pieces and put in a oven dish melt butter in a medium saucepan add flour and mix in  it wont be smooth yet gradually add the milk stirring it in  you want to get to a custard consistency if you run out of milk you can use the juices from the vegetables to get it to a custardlike consistency once it is the right consistency and is starting to boil  add the cheese it will start to thicken now wait a little bit while the cheese melts pour over vegetables if it doesnt go in between the vegetables and just sits on top  put it back on the element and add some more juice or milk to get it right you can leave until you want to cook or cook straight away cook in oven for 30 minutes  or until done if you like it extra cheesy  before you put it in the oven add some mozzarella cheese on top it will be very hot  so be careful
yesterday we were having a roast and made this as a side dish normally for just plain cauliflower cheese you would use more cauliflower instead of broccoli but this was very tasty and incredibly high in anticancer foods
