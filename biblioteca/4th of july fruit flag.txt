this is quick and easy  and very festive to make just before a party or picnic. for ultimate freshness prepare this treat right before serving. present it with toothpicks for spearing the fruit and a bowl of your favorite dip if desired. one variation is to cook crescent rolls in a  8 by 13 pan covered with cream cheese then topped with the fruit. another used a white tray and this would be good on a 8 by 13 cake too. feel free to use your imaginationto see what this looks like go to httpfamilyfun.go.com4thofjuly4thofjulyrecipespatrioticpicnicideasfruitflag686767.
