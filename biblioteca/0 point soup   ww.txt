put first 12 ingredients in a large pot cover and bring to a boil over high heat reduce heat to a simmer and simmer partly covered for 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender leave veggies whole or i use an immersion blender and puree a bit  leaving some veggie chunks stir in parsley and season with salt  pepper and lemon juice
another 0 point soup  just clock full of veggies i dont eat this as snacks as i know some people do but rather as for dinner with sandwiches. this freezes wonderfully in small tupperware containers  which is great to bring to work and heat up in the micro. recipe source www.weightwatchers.com
garlic cloves onion carrots red bell pepper zucchini cabbage swiss chard broccoli thyme vegetable broth parsley salt pepper lemon juice
