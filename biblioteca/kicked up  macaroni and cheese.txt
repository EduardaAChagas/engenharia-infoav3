i have made this quite a few times it is just delicious and a favourite with my family. this recipe makes quite a lot so make certain that you have a very large fry pan or use a dutch oven. the complete recipe is made on top of the stove. make certain to only cook pasta until just firm but a bit tender as the pasta will cook more in the pan. all ingredients may be adjusted to suit taste. i have even added in some chopped cooked bacon...you will love this
