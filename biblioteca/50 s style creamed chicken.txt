got this from a man a can a plan cookbook.  super easy.  we generally add more onions have used as much as 2 cups and caramelize them because we love onions and feel like it gives the dish more flavor that way.  we also add extra seasonings as cream of mushroom soup is a little bland for us.  my favorite is garlic and italian seasoning added while cooking the onion.
