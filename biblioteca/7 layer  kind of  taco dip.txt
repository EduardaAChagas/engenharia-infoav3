in a skillet over medium high heat cook ground beef and season as you like  keep in mind you will be adding the taco seasoning also though once ground beef is cooked drain any fat  grease and return to pan  add taco seasoning and allow all moisture to cook off meanwhile  in a 13x9 pan spread cream cheese on the bottom layer  soften if its easier i just put a baggie on my hand and began spreading next layer refried beans over the cream cheese now evenly put your meat on the next layer cover with cheese if youre eating immediately then put in a 350 degree oven until cheese is melted and all layers are warm  approximately 15 minutes once the cheese is melted and layers are warmed through spread sour cream on top of cheese next put lettuce  tomato  and onions on top enjoy 
i took a bunch of 7 layer dips and a couple of my own ideas and created this recipe for a college football get together and it was a great hit  this is a very forgiving recipe so feel free to use low fat ingredients change ingredients its still wonderful
