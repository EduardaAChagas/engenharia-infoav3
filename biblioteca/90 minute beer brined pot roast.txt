the success of this recipe relies on two things the use of a dutch oven or similar heavy pot with a heavy bottom and that you use a very large piece of aluminum foil to cover not only the roast  but also go up the sides of the pot and over the pots edge the cover must make contact with the foil all around the edge this is what permits the pot roast to cook quickly brining put all of the brine ingredients into a zippered gallonsized plastic bag seal the bag and shake it until the salt and sugar are dissolved and the beer has lost most of its carbonation add the pot roast  seal and shake to coat the roast open an inch long section of the zipper  expel as much air as you can  reseal place on counter for 45 minutes roast place the oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees f remove the roast from the brine and pat dry put the dutch oven over medium high heat and add the oil brown both sides of the roast  about 5 minutes per side  remove to a platter and season with salt and pepper add onions to the pot and saute until golden add the wine and simmer about 1 minute turn off the heat return the meat to the pot protecting your hands with oven mitts  place a sheet of heavyduty aluminum foil over the meat  pressing down until it is covered from edge to edge  letting the excess foil drape over the edge of the pot press the foil against the pot cover the pot with its lid  raise the heat to mediumhigh  and cook until you hear the liquids bubbling place the pot in the oven and cook for 90 minutes  the roast should be dark brown at this point remove and let rest covered for 10 to 15 minutes carefully remove the foil  steam will billow up  i suggest that you pull away the foil from the side farthest away from you first  and remove the roast to a platter skim fat from the liquid  then place the pot over medium high heat whisk the flour into the chicken broth and stir into the liquid in the pot while the gravy thickens  slice the roast against the grain into slices cover with gravy and serve
this recipe is by don mauer a syndicated food columnist. the technique used here makes for a fast yet tender pot roast. the 90 minutes refers to time in the oven there is additional time needed for brining and cooking. do not cook vegetables with the pot roast  cook them separately or parboil and add to the gravy as it cooks. prep times are estimated as i have not made this yet but am looking forward to doing so. please note that the sodium count is off  the sodium is principally in the brine which is discarded.
