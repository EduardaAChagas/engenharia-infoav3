combine all ingredients in a large saucepan simmer slowly uncovered  stirring occasionally  until thickened
this is the only barbecue sauce i use for pulled pork barbecue. from jeff smiths first cookbook the frugal gourmet 1984  one recipe is enough for about 10 lbs. of meat.  it keeps well in a jar in the fridge.   if you dont have liquid smoke try adding some smoked paprika.
beef broth tomato paste salt granulated sugar brown sugar prepared yellow mustard white vinegar liquid smoke worcestershire sauce crushed red pepper flakes chili powder
