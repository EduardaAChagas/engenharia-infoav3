these are the original bran buds cereal muffins that my auntie anne made for me years ago and are now known by all as auntie annes muffins.  she has standing orders to have to have the stack of recipes waiting by the door whenever we eat there bc ill be asking for every single recipe.  she is that good of a chef.  batter keeps up to 6 weeks in the fridge  just the right balance of healthy vs. yummo
