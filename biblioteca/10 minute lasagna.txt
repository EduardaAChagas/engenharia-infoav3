another recipe from real simple magazine from a few years ago.  super fast weeknight supper.  using cheese ravioli instead of traditional lasagna noodles condenses three steps into one.  using the ravioli straight from the freezer could not be more simple.  easily adapted to whatever addinssubstitutions you like.  i  use my own homemade pasta sauce quickly wilt fresh spinach in the microwave and throw in some olives mushrooms or whatever i might have on hand.  you could add browned ground beef or italian sausage to the pasta sauce if you wanted it a meaty lasagna.
