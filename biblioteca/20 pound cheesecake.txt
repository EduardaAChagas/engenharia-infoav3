this is from a yellowed clipping from moms recipe box at least 25 years old from the detroit news. why the name no one knows but speculation has it that its denseness and weight coupled with a slight sense of exaggeration led to the overstated name for the cake. dont be put off by that however. its texture is unusually creamy and tender compared to the thick and heavy fillings found in many homemade cheesecakes. prep time does not include chilling.
