in a big mixing bowl  combine flour  baking powder  soda  and salt cut in butter until it reaches a coarse meal consistency add raisins combine liquids separately add liquids to dry ingredients mix until a soft dough forms at some point it will become hard to stir it  and it will be better to use your hands kneading the dough is the best way to combine all the ingredients completely  knead it gently until it is smooth you can knead it right there in the mixing bowl shape the dough into two balls  and place them on a greased cookie sheet flatten each ball slightly and cut an x about 1  4 deep in the top of each loaf bake at 375 for 35 minutes
i just tried this recipe for the first time and i immediately wanted to put it online so that i would always be able to find it.  its from la leche leagues cookbook whole foods for the whole family.  of course a whole wheat bread is always different from a white flour bread but i was amazed at how well this recipe captures the taste and texture of irish soda bread.  its dense and crumbly and a bit sweet and very delicious.  its also quite easy to make.  its a quick bread recipe  no yeast no rising  but you shape it into round loaves and it feels more bready to me than most quick breads.  i cant wait to make it again.  enjoy
