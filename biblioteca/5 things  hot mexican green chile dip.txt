i take this dip to almost every gathering i go to.....and have never had to haul any of it home  its never had a real name but when people ask whats in ithow do you make it the response is always the same  its so easy.  five things and stir.  you can actually add additional items like diced jalapenos sliced black olives etc to make it your own.....but the basic recipe is always a hit  i use the extra hot rotel to kick it up but for those who prefer milder flavor you can use the regular or even mild rotel.  i do highly recommend rotel rather than any other brand of diced tomatoes wchilis...theres just something about the flavor thats very unique.  enjoy
