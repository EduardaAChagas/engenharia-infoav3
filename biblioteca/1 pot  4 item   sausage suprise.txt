cut all ingredients into quarter sized chunks place all in 8 quart pot of boiling water add salt and pepper to taste boil until carrots and potatoes are tender but firm drain liquid i like to serve with a little mustard or horseradish on the side
i needed to make a quick easy meal for my kids one day and all i had was some kielbasa sausage onions potatoes and carrots.  therefore i cut them up and put into a pot of water wala it was a hit.  my now grown girls make it all the time.
