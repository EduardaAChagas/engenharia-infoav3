spread hummus on platter i usually use a pretty garlicky kind  stir in some olive oil and lemon zest  a little cayenne brown lamb  can use beef or turkey in skillet with garlic and some oregano and marjoram drain well i usually brown my meet  drain and rinse it with boiling water and then add some spices layer meat on top of hummus layer onion  cucumbers  tomatoes and tzaziki the amounts i gave are approximate  use more or less to your preference scatter olives and mint over top serve with freshbaked pita chips and watch it dissappear 
this is like the classic mexican 7layer dip only in a mediterranean way  i sometimes make this and leave the meat out  it is still good and vegetarian thataway  serve with freshbaked pita chips.  i estimated amounts use more or less to your taste.  serving size is approximate too.
