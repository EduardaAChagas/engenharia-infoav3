melt the butter over medium heat in a large saucepan stir in the sugar stir constantly until the toffee mixture turns a lovely caramel color you can add the nuts now  or wait and sprinkle them on top of the chocolate carefully pour the hot toffee onto a large cookie sheet thats been lightly coated with cooking spray after a few minutes  when the toffee begins to set up but is still hot  sprinkle the chocolate chips on top once melted  spread out the chocolate to evenly coat the toffee if you didnt already mix in the nuts  sprinkle them on top of the still warm chocolate  or mix the nuts in and sprinkle them on top  knock yourself out once the toffee is completely cooled  you can break it up into bite size pieces
