this is quite similar to the creamed spinach at boston market well so im told anyway  this is a great side dish even people that hate spinach love this its great to serve along side a holiday turkey or a ham dinner or at any meal  i also like to saute about 2 teaspoons fresh minced garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper in the butter for about 2 minutes before adding in the flour but that is optional add in some grated parmesan cheese too if desired this complete recipe can be doubled
