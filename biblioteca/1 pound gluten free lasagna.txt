i found out i am sensitive to gluten and had a craving for a nice rich lasagna.  fortunately for me theres a good health food store in town and they carry lots of glutenfree products.  i used deboles rice lasagna noodles and found i liked the taste better than wheat noodles.  it was very filling and satisfying.  enjoy
