preheat your oven to 425 degrees place the quinoa and water into a small saucepan  adding a dash of salt and bring to a boil once boiling  reduce heat to a simmer cover  and simmer approximately 15 minutes or until the quinoa is soft and fluffy important you should not let the quinoa absorb all of the water  there should be a couple teaspoons left  although the quinoa will be cooked in a small mixing bowl  combine the warm cooked quinoa  its liquid  the oil  and the flour mush it all together with your hands until a dough like texture is achieved line a baking sheet with parchment paper and shape the dough on it into a circle the crust should be 1 cm thick and yield one pizza about 6 inches in diameter bake ten minutes  flip  and bake ten more minutes you want to keep flipping the pizza so both sides are evenly crisped  however long that takes if you dont do this correctly  the pizza will be wet do not add your toppings until the crust is crisped on both sides  remove from the oven and remove the parchment from the pan now you can add your toppings to your pizza return it to the pan  and bake it for about 10 more minutes  or until everything looks crisp and melted remove from the oven again  cut into pieces  and enjoy 
i have been wanting to try a quinoa based pizza crust for quite some time but all the recipes i have come across require soaking the quinoa for hours on end. i wanted something quick and pizza like. this crust is crispy yet moist in the middle just like a pizza crust should be and it is super easy hello only three ingredients so enjoy the cooking time shown includes time for preparing the quinoa
quinoa water whole wheat flour coconut oil
