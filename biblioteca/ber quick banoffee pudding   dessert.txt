preheat your oven to 200c  400f slice up the banana and place it on an oversized sheet of tin foil dot the two tablespoons of dulche du leche over the top of the bananas bring the opposite corners of the foil together to make a little banana parcel bake in the oven for approximately 15 minutes while the banana is cooking  break your two digestive biscuits  graham crackers into little pieces in a bowl when the bananas are cooked  empty them and the dulche du leche out onto your digestive biscuits  graham crackers and mix well leave to cool for a minute or so and then eat it all up while its nice and hot 
i love this when im home alone for dinner and cant be bothered to make a proper dessert for one or for when i need a quick sugar fix. this is really quick and easy and is so yummy. you could easily multiply the ingredient amounts up to serve any number of people however the presentation means youll probably only ever want to serve it to family rather than company.
