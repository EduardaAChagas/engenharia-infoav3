there are so many luscioussounding recipes on zaar for pork tenderloin marinades that we plan to spend all spring and summer grilling our way through the list. i honestly think though that this one can stand up to the best of them its from a local community cookbook and its way up there on the list of family favorites. you can cut the marinating time to 24 hours but 48 is better. just promise me that you wont cook it to death.  a light char on the outside and pale pink on the inside is perfect. when im expecting a bigger crowd than usual and have to buy 2 packages of tenderloin i stick all 4 pieces of meat in one big ziplock and double the marinade recipe.
