highfiber muffins that are full of flavor.  full of apples carrots and nuts these muffins are so good and great for you. i adapted this recipe from one that came on a box of hodgon mill mulitgrain hot cereal found in the gourmet or health food area of a regular grocery store.  if you can find the hodgon mill hot cereal use it but if you cant find it you can put the same amount of oatmeal in a blender or food chopper and chop until it is very fine.  note the more you use the lowfat options the quicker these will cook.  best is to stick to just one or two lowfat options e.g. just egg whites and skim milk and use veg oil etc.
