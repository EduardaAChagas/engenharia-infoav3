brown sausage in pan  crumbling with spatula  until no pink remains drain and rinse put into a 5 quart crockpot saute onions and garlic in olive oil until translucent and golden but not brown add all the spices and mix well turn off the heat and let the spices mingle for about 10 minutes the heat will let the oils release from the dried herbs add the tomato sauce and spice mixture to the meat in the crockpot and stir to mix cook on high for 1 hour and then low for 78 hours use over pasta if freezing  cool sauce and pour into quart sized freezer bags remove all the air and place flat on a cookie sheet and put into freezer when frozen  they will stand up like records in the freezer
i really did make up this recipe on my own with the help of an italian lady through emails.  the mingling of the oilspices is the key.  we were really into once a month cooking for awhile and this sauce iswas a hit.
