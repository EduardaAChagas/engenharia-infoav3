sounds hard to believe but it is possible to put a whole frozen chicken in the crock pot and have dinner in about 78 hours. when i buy the chicken i unwrap it and take the gizzards out and also remove the paper placed under the bird. i also try to purchase a chicken with a popup timer. then i rewrap the bird and freeze it until im ready to cook it. please keep in mind that i have a new crock pot which seems to be hotter than my old one so cooking times may vary a bit. the original idea for this recipe came from taste of home. this is my modification. hope you enjoy
