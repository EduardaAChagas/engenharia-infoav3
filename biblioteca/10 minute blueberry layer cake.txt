company was coming and i wanted something easy quick yet nice for dessert and came up with this recipe. it was raved over. you may make it in a bowl like a trifle or free standing on a plate. if you assemble it on a plate stick four bamboo skewers through it to keep it from shifting. i used purchased sponge cake or if you like try an angel food cake.  we have a dairy that makes wonderful no fat french vanilla yogurt and it worked well but it is your choice to find your favorite. i used mango french vanilla and some plain french vanilla on top again choose your favorite to compliment the blueberries. this dessert can be made a day ahead and kept in the refrigerator or serve it right away.
