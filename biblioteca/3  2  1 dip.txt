combine the ingredients pour into baking dish bake at 325 for 40 minutes while everyone i know loves this dip  i found it to be a bit bland the second time i made it  i used low fat mayonnaise  and i added one teaspoon garlic powder  and 1  4 teaspoon black pepper i found the taste better  and there wasnt an inch of grease on top of the dip when it came out of the oven
i got this from a friend.  its easy and delicious and fattening.  serve with cocktail bread.  there will be a lot of oil at the top of the dish when it comes out of the oven so be sure to spoon it all off before serving.  also if you like more onion dice a medium onion instead of a small onion.
swiss cheese mayonnaise onion
