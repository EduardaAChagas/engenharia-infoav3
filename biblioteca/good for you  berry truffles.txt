this is just the thing for when you get a chocolate craving but dont want to go for anything too unhealthy. creamy smooth deep chocolate flavor with a hint of berry. very easy to make and pretty much guiltfree i used only about 10 dates and added stevia to taste so there would be less sugars.
walnuts dates frozen raspberries cocoa powder
