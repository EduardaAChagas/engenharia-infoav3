base  in a medium sauce pan  melt the butter over medium heat and add the celery  onion and cook 34 minutes add in the apples and broth and cook until tender it will take about 20 minutes on a medium low simmer  uncovered puree  i used my immersion blender  but you can you can transfer it to a standard blender and puree until smooth season  add in the the sage  and a very small pinch of cloves  go easy ad season with black pepper cook another 10 minutes mascarpone  mix the mascarpone with the brandy  and return to the refrigerator i mixed mine right in the container  save on those dirty dishes serve  i like to serve with a fresh small sprig of sage and a dollop of the brandied mascarpone cheese you can serve this hot  which i prefer  or chilled is also very good and dont forget my sweet savory bread sticks
no need for cream in this soup. some fresh seasoning from sage and the sweetness of the apples make this an amazing easy quick soup. one of the things i like best about this soup is that it has a very clean fresh flavor. this to me makes an amazing starter for a dinner party soup for lunch or served with sandwiches or salad for a great light dinner. and the best part ... this is just as good served chilled as it is hot. i love to serve this with my sweet savory bread sticks.
