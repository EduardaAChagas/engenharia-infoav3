this is a base recipe that is full of nutrient rich ingredients but yet is not overly sweet.  the result is a chewy almost cakelike granola bar though not at all similar to any that you would find in the supermarket.  this recipe is pretty flexible so dont hesitate to modify to suit your tastes.  for a vegan version replace the honey with maple syrup.  and try some of the suggested additions.updated march 2008
