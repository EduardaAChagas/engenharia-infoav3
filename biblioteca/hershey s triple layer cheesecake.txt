originally found on the hersheyskitchens.com site. this is fantastically wonderful it is too much  it is so awesome cant find anymore expletives to describe this dessert. hope you enjoy this as much as we have over the years. i did not include 3 hour refrigerator time in passive cook time. also the triple drizzle is optional. dont let the long list of explanations bother you it is mostly repetitive. give it a try  i am sure you will like it.
