mix all ingredients except lettuce and cheese in a bowl and season with salt  pepper to taste serve on bed of chopped romaine lettuce and sprinkle with feta cheese
this high protein fresh tasting vegetarian salad is very quick and easy to prepare. in fact it can be made in just 15 minutes from start to finish and can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator getting more flavorful as it marinates longer. using fresh herbs and a small amount extra virgin olive oil makes this a healthier salad than many of those with high fat dressings without losing flavor.recipe found on httpwww.whfoods.comgenpage.phptnamerecipedbid57
