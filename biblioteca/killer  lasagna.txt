brown the sausage and ground meat and drain all the fat add all the other ingredients for the meat filling and simmer on the stove  uncovered  for about 1  2 hour i usually add a bay leaf or two mix up the cheese filling and set aside in fridge until ready to use put the noodles in salted water and cook until soft when poked with a fork when the noodles are done  drain the noodles and rinse off with cold water so they can be handled easily spray the baking pan with a nonstick spray and put a layer of noodles down on the bottom of the pan it is ok to cut some of the noodles to fit into the pan if they do not fit whole spread half the cheese filling over the noodels  then half of the mozarella cheese on top of that  then half of the meat sauce over the grated mozarella cheese repeat layers and then top with more mozarella cheese bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes let stand for 10 minutes before cutting into it leftovers can be easily stored in the freezer
