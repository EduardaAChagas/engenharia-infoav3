if youre like me youre always on the quest for the perfect mac and cheese.  now ive eaten a lot of mac and cheese because its the ultimate comfort food and my family and  i love it but i had never found the penultimate recipe for it...always on the search...well i think i may just have come up with it  using the mac and cheese recipe posted at the splendidtable.com as a jumpingoff point i devised this version which is rich creamy supercheesey and inordinantly delicious.  i can certainly be significantly lightened down by using lowfat milk and cheeses.
