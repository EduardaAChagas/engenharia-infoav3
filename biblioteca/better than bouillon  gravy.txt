i found this recipe on youtube......for times when you dont have meat drippings this makes a nice smooth gravy without all the junk added to jar gravy or gravy mixes.  i  like to make the beef gravy then heat meatballs in it and add a little sour cream for a nice comfort food to serve over noodles.better than bouillon can be found in your grocery near the soup bases or the chicken or beef broth.
water beef base cornstarch pepper
