nuke the blueberries for 1 minute in the microwave in the same bowl  combine with the cottage cheese  vanilla  and sprinkling of cinnamon to your liking then eat it 
i was craving blueberry tonight but wanted none of the calories...so i reached for my proteinrich friend friendship cottage cheese cottage cheese is rough on its own and makes you think its another miseryinducing diet food. well it doesnt have to be frozen blueberries are a must for this not fresh because i find that the frozen actually tends to be of better quality no bitterness and when you nuke em they give off this syrup that has no added sugars. this takes barely 1 minute to whip up tastes great and is a great rushhour breakfast afterschool or afterdinner treat
