inspired by recipe361967 i experimented and made up this cake for the two of us.  i did try it with twice as much baking soda and baking powder reduced them both to 18 as the cake touched the microwave ceiling and started to curve down tasted fine but sure looked bizaar. think it needs these ingredients to get a cake texture. i doubt that this recipe can be reduced and work out. thank you especially to debbwl and diner524 for trying to help me improve this recipe for two.
