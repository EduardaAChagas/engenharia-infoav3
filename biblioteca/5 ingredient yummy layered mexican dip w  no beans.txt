this recipe has been passed down from my best friends mom barb guesman. it is super easy with only 5 ingredients and practically no prep time  its perfect for throwing together for an unexpected guest or a quick snack  we love it for football games holiday parties or any get together. i have eaten many pans of this for dinner... by myself i am sorry to sayyou can prep this at home and bring it with you... travels well. and it has no beans enjoy
