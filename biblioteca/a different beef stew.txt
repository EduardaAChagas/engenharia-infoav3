this is always how weve made beef stewmy family wasnt partial to the beef stock gravy. im not a ketchup fan but in this recipe it has its place. i always add a little extra to my bowl. were not big meat eaters so if you want to add more beef cubes feel free.i was missing a crucial step aparently as my dad showed me just recently. making the slurry makes it so you can add less ketchup and still have the thick sauce
