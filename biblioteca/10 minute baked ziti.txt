preheat oven to 400 combine the sauce and water in a mixing bowl stir in the ricotta  parmesan  and 1  2 the mozzarella  then the uncooked ziti spoon the mixture into a 9x13 baking dish and cover with foil bake for 55 minutes remove the foil  sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella  and bake for an additional 5 minutes
the title 10minute is a little misleading because the 10 minutes refers to prep time only but thats the title on the recipe card  it has to bake a whole other hour after that.  still i do love me some pasta with cheese and sauce on it  the recipe is just a basea very good base by itself easy as pie to jazz it up with ground beef or italian sausage extra onions garlic spiceswhatever strikes your fancy  higher fat or lower fat depending on if you use lowfat ricotta parmesan and mozzarella.  this came from a cookbook i had once but darn if i know which one or where it even is
ragu tomato sauce water ricotta cheese parmesan cheese mozzarella cheese ziti pasta italian seasoning garlic powder
