honestly  i never measure exactly  also  use as much or as little cheese as you would like cook macaroni according to directions when draining  run cold water over to keep it from sticking together and to chill it mix mayonnaise  miracle whip  onion  pickle juice and sugar together to make sauce  after macaroni is completely drained  mix macaroni  sauce  eggs and cheese until everything is coated and mixed well the longer it chills  the better it gets 
whenever we go somewhere for a back yard bbq i am asked to bring my macaroni salad. i think the secret that makes this macaroni salad different from others is the mixture of miracle whip and mayo. you know some people like mayo...some like miracle whip. this way everybody is half pleased this is another one of my throw together recipes so i have tried my best to give some type of measurements.
