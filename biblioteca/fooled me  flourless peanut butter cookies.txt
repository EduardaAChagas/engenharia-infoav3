after tasting similar cookies at a picnic we excitedly left with our friends recipe.  we were intrigued by the technique but determined to eliminate that odd aftertaste which so often results from using splenda in baked goods.  we also wanted the finished cookie to be a bit less dry and crumbly.   a few tweaks later we enjoyed a terrific batch of glutenfree peanut butter cookies which could stand up against the best of traditionalmethod cookies.   these quick cookies freeze well if you want need to reserve them for portion control.   and with only 3 tablespoons of real sugar divided across 16 cookies one or two a day wont wreck your south beach or diabetic menu plan.we are usually tempted to double the vanilla in any recipe but here the small amount of vanilla adds a depth of flavor without interfering with the rich peanut taste.please note that the 5 minute preparation time does not include the 30 minutes this dough needs to rest in the refrigerator.
