to my surprise i just discovered that our favorite broccoli cornbread recipe isnt among the dozens posted on zaar.  i share it with one warning  its not a healthy dish to begin with and this version is more sinful than most.  it sure is yummy though  we particularly enjoy this in the summertime as an accompaniment to a vegetable dinner of turnip greens blackeyed peas squash and slices of homegrown tomatoes.  given that menu the calorie and cholesterol police never even notice.    the original recipe specifies a 9x13 baking dish.  however i discovered by accident that its really best when made in a dish thats 7x11.  if you happen to have that odd size do use it.
