i had previously browned and drained the ground beef and had it in the fridge  if you dont have this leftover  brown ground beef first in a nonstick skillet  drain off fat really well i use a pile of paper towels to soak up the fat place ground beef in a large pot stir in all other ingredients except the sugar bring to a boil  stirring occasionally turn heat down to low and simmer uncovered or covered for about 30 minutes or so to let the flavors mix  stirring occasionally taste the sauce now and then and add more onions or garlic to taste add a little sugar to neutralize the acidity of the tomatoes during the simmering serve over hot spaghetti noodles the sauce should be fairly thick  not runny  so as you add in the ingredients  use more or less of the prego as needed if too thick  add a little water  more prego  or more stewed tomatoes with juice when i made mine  it was the consistency of chili this makes a pretty decent batch  can feed 24 depending on how much everyone eats in a serving
i love eating ground beef in my spaghetti sauce. heres another recipe i made up this time with leftovers i had in the fridge and also what i had on hand in the pantry. we were on a tight budget at the time so i just threw a bunch of stuff together and it came out quite good and my husband enjoyed it too again my measurements are all estimated i apologize.
