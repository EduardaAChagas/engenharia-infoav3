preparing dough for storage warm the water slightly it should feel just a little warmer than body temperature warm water will rise the dough to the right point for storage in about 2 hours with cold water it will need 34 hours add the yeast to the water in a 5 quart bowl or  preferably  in a resealable  lidded plastic food container or foodgrade bucket dont worry about getting it all to dissolve mix in the flour and salt  kneading is unnecessary add all of the flour at once  measuring it in with dryingredient measuring cups  by gently scooping up the flour  then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula dont press down into the flour as you scoop or youll throw off the measurement mix with a wooden spoon  a highcapacity food processor fitted with the dough attachment  or a heavy duty stand mixer fitted with the dough hook until the mixture is uniform if youre hand mixing and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon  you can reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together dont knead  it isnt necessary youre finished when everything is uniformly moist  without dry patches it takes a few minutes  and will yield a dough that is wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container allow to rise cover with lid allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse  approx 2 hours  depending on room temperature  and initial water temperature longer rising times  up to 5 hours  wont harm the result you can use a portion of the dough any time after this period fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature on baking day prepare your loaf tin  tray  or whatever youre baking it in  on sprinkle the surface of your refrigerated dough with four pull up and cut of a grapefruitsize piece of dough  using a serrated knife hold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it wont stick to your hands gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all 4 sides  rotating the ball a quarterturn as you go most of the dusting flour will fall off  thats fine  it isnt meant to be incorporated the bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends  but it will sort itself out during resting and baking the correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive the entire process should take no more than 30  60 seconds rest the loaf and let it rise in the form  on the tray  pizza peel  for about 40 minutes depending on the age of the dough  you may not see much rise during this period thats fine  more rising will occur during baking twenty minutes before baking  preheat the oven to 450f place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other shelf that wont interfere with the rising bread dust and slash dust the top of the loaf liberally with flour  which will allow the slashing knife to pass without sticking slash a quarter inch deep cross  diagonal lines  or tictactoe pattern on top using a serrated knife after a 20 min preheat youre ready to bake  even though the oven thermometer wont be at full temperature yet put your loaf in the oven pour about 1 cup of hot water into the broiler tray and close the oven to trap the steam bake for about 30 minutes  or until the crust is nicely browned and firm to the touch store the rest of the dough in the fridge in your lidded container and use it over the next 14 days the flavour and texture improves  becoming like sourdough even 24 hours of storage improves the flavour this is the standard bread there are loads of variations  both savory and sweet  in the book
this is the basic boule bread mix from the book artisan bread in five minutes a day by jeff hertzberg and zoe francois.  ive mainly posted this recipe so that i dont have to hook out the book every time.  the dough is stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks taking out a bit each day as you need it forming it and baking it.  a forum i belong to love this bread which is what inspired me to get the book.  most of them cook it in a remoska which is a gadget that i find invaluable.  remoskas are from checkoslavakia and i believe theyve just come to the states.  in the uk theyre available from strongly recommend getting the book if you like this bread.  they have lots of different kinds of bread which you make in this way also sweet ones plus ideas on how to ring the changes recipes to use up the stale bread etc.  ps  someone said they were having difficulty getting hold of the book so i tried to post an amazon link for it here.  but it just comes out as html gobbledey gook  if anyone knows how to do it please let me know.  otherwise try amazon guys    very very worth getting the book.
