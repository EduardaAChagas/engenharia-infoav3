this recipe is dedicated to andi of longmeadow farm chef 428885 and her beloved cows see that backwards is swoc.  a friend made these for a fun afternoon treat and i fell in love.  when i asked what they were called she said cow pie cookies.  i immediately thought of andi and her love of all things swoc.  so im posting this since i could not find a recipe just like it and especially in honor of sweet andi.  the amount of cookies is a complete guess at this point.
