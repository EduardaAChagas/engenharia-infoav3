if you are using button mushrooms  leave them whole slice field mushrooms fairly thinly in a serving bowl  combine all of the ingredients and toss to coat the mushrooms well at this point taste the dressing  it may need more lemon  or oil it really depends on your personal preference  however it should be slightly tart refrigerate for at least 4 hours  tossing occasionally
this has been one of my recipes for ages. i got it from a magazine but ive no idea which one. it is very simple to make and looks very impressive as part of an antipasto platter. cooking time is refrigeration time. i prefer to use field mushrooms because they have more flavour but it has a more dramatic visual effect if you use the buttons. they also soak up a lot of flavour from the dressing. since the dressing is so simple it relies on good ingredients. please use fresh everything for optimal results.
