take equal parts of beer and lemon lime soda over just a little ice to keep it chilled be careful it will foam up a lot so take it slow as you come to taste it  you can change how much beer or soda  if you really like beer the combination can be 3  4 beer to 1  4 soda in germany  at least where i lived in the bavarian area in the south  this is very popular with the young people worth a try  
as i watch my dear food network right now its on dinner impossible with robert making meals from beer and this reminds me of something i learned when i was living in the southern part of germany.  i figured i should share this as we dont get anything like this in the u.s. but its really good.  i normally dont like beer that much because its too bitter for my taste most times and german beer is the strongest i know  anyway this recipe can be made with any kind of beer but dark beer works really well.  the combination sweetens up the beer a little lowers the alcohol content even more and gives it a unique taste its a little sweeter and less bitter i guess you could call this the german version of a wine cooler... try it for your next party even those who dont normally choose beer as their drink at a party will like it.
