prep your full monty preheat the broiler to high put a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet halve the tomatoes trim the stalks of the mushrooms and clean them lightly remove any fat from the bacon score the sausages lengthways and open them out so they are flat put the tomatoes  mushrooms and sausages on the wire rack  with the tomatoes cut side up and the mushrooms stalk side up sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over the tomatoes and mushrooms very lightly rub them with the oil  you dont need much  even an olive oil spray would work  to cook your full monty put the cookie sheet  with wire rack  filled with your prepped ingredients under the broiler for about 5 minutes meanwhile put a pot of water on to boil after 5 minutes  add the bacon to the wire rack and turn the sausages over put it back under the broiler and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes this all depends on the heat and speed of your broiler watch it carefully cook this until the bacon is golden and crispy meanwhile  put the beans into a small saucepan over a medium heat  to warm through put your slices of bread into the toaster crack the eggs into the pan of simmering water and poach for 2 to 3 minutes to test if they are ready  carefully remove one of them using a slotted spoon and touch it gently with your finger if it feels too soft  give it a minute or so more in the water once the eggs are done to your liking  remove them and drain on paper towels to serve your full monty divide everything between 2 serving plates and sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over the eggs enjoy 
this takes a traditional full english breakfast and gives it a healthier twist thanks to chef jamie oliver you can get a full monty in under 500 calories. its actually a lot healthier than most pastries muffins and croissants. give it a go i have to admit that i used regular bacon instead of the canadian bacon. personal preference. its up to you
