in a medium sized saucepan heat olive oil over medium heat add onion  garlic  basil  salt  pepper  and cinnamon cook mixture until onion and garlic are translucent  57 minutes  stirring occasionally reduce heat if onions and  or garlic start to brown empty the tomatoes into a separate bowl using your hands  squeeze and crush each tomato add the tomatoes and juice to the onion and garlic mixture add the cup of beef stock over medium heat  continue cooking uncovered until sauce reduces by 1  3  stirring occasionally to make sure sauce doesnt burn use the sauce in a meaty lasagna or sub it for any other sauce in any other recipe for a change
great for a meaty rich dish or just for a change of pace over your other sauce.  very simple to make and impresses easily.  inspired by a dish at panzanos in denver from their menu in the winter of 0607.
