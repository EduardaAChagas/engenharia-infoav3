i prepared this as a snack for my husband this afternoon as i had made chili and guacamole earlier in the day.  at first i thought i would throw together some classic nachos but then i remembered that in the past the results sometimes yielded some soggy chips while others didnt have any of the goods on them.  3 minutes under the broiler for these babies and youre guaranteed that every chip will burst with that mexican flavour that everybody loves.  the only problem with this recipe my husband says is that youre left wanting more.
