a must try there are tons of recipes for baked beans but these will really stand out and how great...they freeze beautifully i call them 3 way because you can really use any 3 kinds of beans you like. and once combined you have 3 options to choose what to do with them. i adapted this recipe to suit my family and the freezer. the original is from beyond macaroni and cheese.
