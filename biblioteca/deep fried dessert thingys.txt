in a large bowl  mix flour  granulated sugar  baking powder and salt make a well in the center of the flour mixture  and pour in milk  vanilla  egg and 2 tablespoons oil mix until smooth heat remaining vegetable oil to 400 degrees in a small deep fryer oil is hot enough when it starts to ripple be careful not to overheat butter one side of each bread slice sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon evenly onto the buttered side of the bread slices make sandwiches by placing the slices of bread together with the brown sugar on the inside cut the sandwiches into quarters now is a good time to test the oil by dropping in a very small amount of batter batter should sizzle and brown in about 20 seconds oil needs to be hot enough to melt the brown sugar inside the sandwiches but not so hot that it scorches the batter dip the sandwiches into the batter mixture using deep fryer tongs  carefully place the battered sandwiches into the heated oil be cautious when deep frying try to avoid burns from splattering hot oil remove sandwiches from the oil when they are golden brown set aside to cool for a couple of minutes sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve
my mother used to make this for us as a special treat. i dont know where she got this recipe or what it is called hence the title. my husband loves this and encouraged me to submit it. this recipe is full of sugar and oil and is as unhealthy as a desert can be but very yummy.
