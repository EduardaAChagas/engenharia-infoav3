i was craving something light sweet and smoothielike tonight but wasnt sure what. and then it hit me  a drinkable chocolate chip cookie i set out here on zaar to see what i could find and didnt find much. so i started looking for some edible cookie dough recipes to take inspiration from and this is what i came up with. as the title suggests i consider this an ongoing experiment. feel free to contribute your suggestions recipe may be doubled tripled etc. according to the size of your blender.
