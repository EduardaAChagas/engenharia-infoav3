this is a great meatloaf recipe.  the mushroom sauce is the best.  i have doubled the recipe split it and and will freeze the two loaves for future meals. i can defrost a meatloaf the night before to save a little time the next day.  i got this recipe out of the cuisine at home magazine and is always asked for the recipe by friends.
