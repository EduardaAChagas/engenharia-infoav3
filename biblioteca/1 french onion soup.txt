by far the best onion soup ive ever eaten...and i love food it freezes well..just freeze the soup and prepare the bread separately.  it sounds like a lot of work but its not and it is well worth it.  the recipe is supposed to make 8 servings...but in our house it only makes 4  the measurements for cheese can be altered depending on your tastes.
