picked up this recipe at a local elmers restaurant. it sounds so good and easy to prepare. they were giving out the recipe free so i guess its ok to post here. i havent tried it yet but the card said it takes only minutes to produce the besttasting summer salsa ready for dipping topping and summertime fun. cooking time includes standing time.
