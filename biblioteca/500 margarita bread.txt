this is probably 2 of my top ten all time favorites.  the recipe won harold freeman of phoenix 150 in a newspaper contest probably 20 years ago.  he should have easily won 500 as ive made many life long friends equally addicted to harolds tipsy bread. i usually make it in mini foil pans for gifts. dont skip the special cheese spread as it really adds the lagniappe  try it soon and maybe we can each chip in another 5 to bring harold his just reward for a great recipe
