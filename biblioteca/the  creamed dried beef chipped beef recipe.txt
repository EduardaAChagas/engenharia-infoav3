this is a longtime favorite recipe of our lancaster county pa family passed down from my mom. she gets requests for it all the time and has to make double or triple this amount now whenever she makes it so everyone has some to take along home too. for me its a true comfort food if there ever was one we always serve it over toast andor homefried potatoes. my dad refers to it as s.o.s. from his days in the service. recipe makes about 4 servings for our hungry family but it freezes very well so any leftovers wont go to waste.
