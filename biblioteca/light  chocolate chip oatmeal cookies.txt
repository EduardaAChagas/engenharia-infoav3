combine margarine  sugar  egg  vanilla and cinnamon stir until creamy and smooth i microwave the margarine for about 30 seconds to soften add flour and baking powder and stir until completely combined add oats and then chocolate chips spoon onto greased cookie sheets with a soup spoon with about an inch between each cookie bake at 350 f for 11 minutes i used two sheets in the oven at once  and if you do that  switch the bottom sheet with the top sheet after about 5 minutes and then continue cookie let cool
these are so i can feel ok with my toddler son eating them.  obviously you could omit the chocolate chips and theyd be even better...  but i didnt want to go crazy.  i use earth balance margarine and enjoy life chocolate chips because theyre dairyfree.  i also have substituted 12 a cup of the whole wheat flour with garbanzo bean flour.
