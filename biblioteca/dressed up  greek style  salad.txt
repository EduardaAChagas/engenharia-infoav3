cut red onion in half  then slice thinly prepare other vegetables place torn romaine  greens in serving bowl  keeping top as smooth a layer as possible salt and pepper greens to your liking starting at edge of bowl  make circular rings of sliced onion  then tomatoes  carrots  green peppers  olives and in the center a dollop of feta cheese cover with plastic wrap until ready to serve then present with greek salad dressing of your choice served on the side
this is a variation of another dressedup salad i make for special occasions.  this one is for my occasional irish girls greek night parties the salad makes an outstanding presentation by being totally covered with colorful vegetable rings with a circular dollop of feta cheese in the center.  after everyone ooos and aaahs toss it and serve with your favorite greek dressing.  i use a portion of recipe 68485 the remainder of which stores nicely in frig.  i hope you enjoy this very pretty twist of a green salad recipe.  note   amounts below are realistic but not written in stone.  measurements also depend on the size of the salad bowl and amount of greens in it since the salads wardrobe has to totally cover top of greens i have also used thinlysliced celery andor small pieces of cauliflower as part of the ring wardrobe
romaine lettuce salt and pepper red onion cherry tomatoes carrots green peppers black olives feta cheese
