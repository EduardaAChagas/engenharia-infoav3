tired of eating candycane joejoe cookies straight out of the box  try them in this recipe  note  this year ive also seen peppermint oreos so you could use those if you dont have a trader joes near you.  these delicious fudgey brownies are made with the popular candycane chocolate wafer cookie available at trader joes during the holidays.  make these early in the day as they slice best when cooled completely.
