place pork hocks in a stock pot and cover with 6 cups cold water or enough to really cover them cover and place over fire until the hocks come to a boil while this is coming to a boil  chop your onions  celery  carrots and beans when the pot has boiled there will be a lot of foam at the top of the pot  pour everything out and rinse the pot and meat well  then move to step 4 this is so that you dont have floaty things in the soup later if you decide to miss cleaning everything just move straight to step 4 right away otherwise  you need to add 6 cups clean cold water before step 4 add the garlic  seasonings and the chopped vegetables bring the pot back to a boil  turn down and simmer 1 1  2 to 2 hours or until the pork hock is loosened and tender remove the pork hock from the pot and cool return the stock to the fire and continue simmering until youve moved to the next step while the pork hock is cooling  chop the potato and prepare the first four beets to prepare the beets  peel them  cut them lengthwise in half  turn cut side down and slice into 1  8 thin slices across the width of the beet lay the slices down and cut these into 18 slices across the width of the beet this method gives the prettiest presentation add the potato to the pot and return the soup to a slow boil  then add the beet slices do not let the soup boil once the beets are added or it will lose its color while this is coming up to heat  clean the pork hock and return them to the pot make sure to get all the ugly bits and fat  but leave the meat as whole as you can  better to shred it in you bowl  trust me  leave this to simmer very slowly until the potato is cooked and the beets are tender meanwhile  chop the beet stalks and the leaves and peel and grate the final 2 beets add the peas and tops  leaves to the pot when the peas are cooked add the grated beets continue to cook very slowly once everything is tender you can finally add the dill and 1  2 teaspoon of sour salt tasting is important here  i usually add about 1 1  2 teaspoons of sour salt myself  but i prefer it a bit sour i taste all the way through because i love the way the flavor builds  but it is very important at the end adjust the dill  salt and sour salt carefully  with some practice youll find a soup that everyone loves add more water if this soup begins looking dry  but it is a thick soup so doesnt require a lot of broth  cream will be added at the table you can park the soup overnight in the fridge and remove all the fat that rises the next day this soup is excellent on day 1 but even better day 2  and healthier when the fat is removed the broth shouldnt be sweet and it should have a bit of a sour tang and a taste of dill the soup should never be salty because the meat may call for some seasoning in the bowl this soup is better the next day  and may be put in jars and canned or frozen add sour cream or whipped cream at the table as a garnish more fresh dill is pretty and tasty as well ask my friend katlin  he loves this soup 
this method was taught to my mom by my paternal baba so that her son wouldnt starve after they married. my ukrainian husband has taken a liking to it and with some compromises weve decided this is the best way.  it is different than any other method of making this soup than ive ever seen.  it is also very  very good  the list of ingredients is daunting but the procedure is simple especially if you dont mind a bit of chopping
