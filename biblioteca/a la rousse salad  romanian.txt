another romanian recipe from my romanian friend carmen.  i love the tangy flavor of this romanian potato salad.  the pickled red bell pepper can be difficult to find.  if you cant find it carmen suggests to just double amount of pickles as a replacement so it keeps the good sour taste.  she did this when she made it for a cooking demonstration and it tasted great  the vegetarian sausages are optional but i personally think they are a must as they give the salad great flavor.
