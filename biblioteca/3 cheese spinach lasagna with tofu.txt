for a healthier version use lowfat mozzarella and cottage cheese. if you would like to freeze one of the pans for later use put it in the freezer before cooking it and cook for an hour and 12 instead of 1 hour when you are ready to use it. this was modified from a recipe in real people cookin low fat.
