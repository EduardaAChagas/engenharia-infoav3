this is another version of the 7 layer salad but it does not contain any cheese. my family prefers it. i hope you like it it is requested often. it will not seem like enough dressing at first but trust me just keep mixing. this is a wonderful version given to me by a dear friend patty over 20 years ago. if you forget to take the peas out to thaw no worries i do that all the time and put them in there frozen.
