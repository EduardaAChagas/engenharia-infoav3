preheat oven to 375f cook the diced bacon until crispy  remove from bacon fat and drain on paper towel forget everything you were ever taught about peeling potatoes  and peel them with a knife leaving a good bit of potato on the skin retain center of potatoes for another recipe  or slice them into wedges and cook in the same manner as the potato skins deep fry the potato skins until crispy and golden drain thoroughly and salt to taste spread the potato skins evenly on a pizza pan sprinkle evenly with the green onions  cheese and bacon bake for 1015 minutes until hot and cheddar is melted serve hot with sour cream for dipping
theres a pub we go to that makes their own french fries and instead of throwing out the skins they fry them up and bake them with toppings in a pizza pan. they bring them sizzling to your table in the pizza pan with sour cream for dipping. dare i say that they are better than the french fries not a low calorie item but so good. this is my attempt to duplicate them.
