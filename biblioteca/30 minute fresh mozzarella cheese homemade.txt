crush the rennet into the water and stir to dissolve pour milk into a nonreactive pot place over medium heat sprinkle the citric acid over the milk and stir a few times heat milk to 88f milk will begin to curdle at 88f  add the rennet solution and continue stirring slowly every few minutes until the milk reaches 105f turn off the heat large curds will appear and begin to separate from the whey with a slotted spoon or mesh strainer  scoop the curd into a large glass bowl press the curds gently with your hand and pour off as much whey as possible microwave curds on high for 1 minute  then drain off all the excess whey with a spoon  press curds into a ball until cool microwave two more times for 35 seconds each  and continue to drain the whey and work cheese into a ball in the meantime  place the whey over medium heat and let it heat to about 175f when cheese is cool enough to touch  knead it like bread dough until smooth when you can stretch it like taffy  it is done you can sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons salt into the cheese while kneading and stretching it the cheese will become stretchy  smooth and shiny if it is difficult to stretch and breaks easily  dip it into the hot whey for a few seconds to make it warm and pliable then pick it up again and stretch it into a long rope fold over and stretch again dip in hot whey as needed to make the cheese pliable when the cheese is smooth and shiny  it is ready to eat shape it into a log or golfsize balls  then store in a solution of 2 teaspoons salt to 1 cup water
homemade fresh mozzarella cheese has fabulous flavor. the instructions here for making your own at home are detailed but not difficult. rennet and citric acid can be found in health food stores and specialty markets mail order and some pharmacies. from home cheese making by ricki carroll workman publishingi made this and its easy. if you can make pizza dough you can make this cheese and you can basically make it in the time it takes for your dough to rise.  wow it is so much better than store bought.  id give it 5 stars but i posted it so.....fyi fresh mozzarella doesnt keep well and is best consumed the day it is made
