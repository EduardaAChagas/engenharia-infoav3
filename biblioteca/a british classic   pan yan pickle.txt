a classic british nocook pickle for your sandwiches and cheese board remember pan yan pickle it was a firm favourite in our home and my dad loved it slathered on top of cheese on toast now sadly discontinued this fabulous british pickle with the catchy name is easy to make i have fiddled around and recreated this recipe and i am delighted with the results even though i say so myself. lighter and with more tang then branston pickle i love it in sandwiches. adjust the curry powder to your own tastes.
