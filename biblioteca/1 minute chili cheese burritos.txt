take one flour tortilla  put it on a microwaveable plate and spread a layer of refried beans in the middle of the tortilla leaving lots of room free on the sides for easy rolling i put on about 2t  my husband maybe 3t of beans pour a strip of taco sauce long ways down the beans  about 12t grab a handful of cheese and put on top of the beans and sauce  about 1  4 cup microwave 30 seconds on high roll it up like a burrito and microwave 2030 seconds more repeat for remaining tortillas  or for however many you can eat all ingredients can stay in fridge for later enjoy while piping hot 
i really like fast food chili cheese burritos i know scary but these are even faster and taste just the same literally 1 minute to make too well not quite but really close excellent late night snack also the beauty of this recipe is that there isnt really a recipe make it how hot you want however many you want etc.
