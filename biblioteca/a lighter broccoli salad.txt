i looove broccoli salad but have always had a little trouble feeling good about eating it since it has so many calories so i took a classic recipe and made it just a little lighter. its still not as healthy as eating plain ol broccoli but it is delicious i love to have this in the fridge to grab whenever i get a craving for a snack
