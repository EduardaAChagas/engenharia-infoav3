this is a creation for my 4 year old  boy hunter inspired by his favorite tv show little bear. you could use any fish in this recipe but catfish seems to have the best texture when cooked and holds together better than more flaky fish. it may seem like a lot of work but really does go together easily and even the kids like it its a bit of a cross between a soup a stew and a gumbo with a slight tomato base and a bit of spice. the measurements are not very exact just do what seems right and adjust to taste.
