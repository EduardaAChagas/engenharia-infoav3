place the oil in the bottom of a saucepan cook the diced tomatoes in saucepan on low heat continually stir them add pepper and salt early on in the cooking of the tomatoes when the tomatoes are nearly cooked add the dry sherry now leave the tomatoes for 1 minute so that all the sherry is absorbed in the tomatoes add the tomato sauce and stir in and then add the paprika add the water slowly so that the thickness is what you desire serve on top of steak or as part of a fancy dish
this sauce was like heaven had come to my lips. i used it on a freshly peppered steak which was an experience. this is now my favourite sauce. it is more of a gourmet sauce and is not sickly so you can serve large quantitys on a single piece of meat.
