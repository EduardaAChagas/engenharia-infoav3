i have no money so i had to make something to eat out of what i had hanging around not much. this is what i ended up with i had to eat it by itself but i think it would be good with a juicy steak or some grilled marinated portabello mushrooms. the flavor of the rice depends on the tea im thinking about making some rice with lemon tea and black pepper basil dill and red pepper to have with some fish. i used 14 teaspoon as a standard measurement for all the spices they are meant to be to taste.
water white rice tea bag seasoning salt black pepper dried basil chili powder garlic powder cayenne pepper soy sauce lemon juice butter
