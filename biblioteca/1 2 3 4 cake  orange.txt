my mother just gave me a whole box of recipes and i found this recipe in it. it sounded so good i baked it for a bake sale. a woman bought a couple of pieces liked it so much that she came back and bought the rest of the cake. definitely a keeper... very easy tasty and versatile. i made it in a 9x13 pan. you can use milk or water instead of orange juice but i really liked the flavour of the orange juice and the raisins in it.
