i use a fajita seasoning mix i buy at super walmart called fiesta fajita seasoning mix. basically it is salt free and made with herbs  spices. pepper is a main ingredient and not too much cumin. this mix is not one of the packaged things. i hope you can find it or something similar because it makes fajita making fast and simple
