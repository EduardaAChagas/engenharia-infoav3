this dessert used to be the hit of our young married sunday school class potlucks and it is still a delicious dessert today this is a very versatile dessert as you can really use any flavor of pudding you like. i have used lemon butterscotch and banana cream in the past and they have turned out really well. you could also combine two like chocolate and banana cream or create your own i have posted the original recipe though.
