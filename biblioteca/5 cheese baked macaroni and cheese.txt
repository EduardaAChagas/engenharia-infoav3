ive adapted this recipe off of others after not finding exactly what i want in the ones ive tried.try not to use extra sharp or aged cheeses they dont melt well and contribute to the grainy texture everyone talks about in macaroni and cheese.also make sure all your cheese is grated and macaroni is boiled and drained before finishing the cheese sauce. overcooking or letting it sit too long can also make the texture grainy.
