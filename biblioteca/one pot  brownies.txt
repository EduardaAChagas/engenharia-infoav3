this recipe was submitted by mrs. stuart padnos for a cookbook fund raiser put out by members of the junior welfare league holland michigan about 30 or so years ago. my mom brought the cookbook back to me as a souvenir of their trip. ive made these brownies all these years and have great luck with them every time. i like to top them with an easy cooked chocolate fudge icing that i got from a bowling partner several years ago. these brownies are like a chocolate cakenot gooey like some recipes and i do personally like them plain without nuts or raisins.
