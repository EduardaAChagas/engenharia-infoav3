scrub the sweet potatoes and leave the skin on i like using a french fry cutter for this but if you dont have one  just use a knife to cut the potatoes into shoestrings put the raw fries into a mixing bowl  and pour in the olive oil toss well to coat add the seasonings and toss well again arrange the fries on a baking sheet and bake at 400f for 10 minutes turn the fries with a spatula and bake for another 10 minutes blot any excess oil with paper towels  serve  and enjoy 
perfectly zesty sweet potato fries to accompany veggie burgers and a ton of other dishes youll love them even if youre not as big a fan of sweet potatoes
