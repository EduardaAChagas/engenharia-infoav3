you will be so glad you tried this by the wonderful flavor you would never guess how easy this dish is to prepare. it can be ovenready in less than 5 minutes...then forget about it great simple family meal and so tender. whip up some mashed potatoes or serve over rice dress it up with asparagus bundles. fresh green beans with new potatoes  bacon also goes well with it. recipe from mrs. theda of norman 1st presbyterian church
