place ingredients in bread machine  using either the order given in your bread machine manual  or start with wet ingredients first and add dry ones last  ending with the yeast on top select basic bread setting if just letting the breadmaker bake it i like to select the dough setting  and form the bread or rolls myself if the dough cycle was selected in the previous step  form the dough in desired shapes and placed in greased pan this recipe makes about 15 rolls  2 medium loaves of bread  or 1 large loaf and a few extra rolls cover dough with plastic wrap or floursack towel  and let rise in warm  draftfree spot about 25 minutes for rolls  or 40 minutes for bread works for me make sure to preheat oven to 350 about 1015 minutes before rolls  bread are to be baked bake rolls 1215 minutes  bread 20 minutes ive found that i can put the rolls in a light colored pan and the large bread loaf in a dark pan and they will come out at about the same time if you want a loaf that isnt quite as heavy  you can do just 1 cup 9 grain cereal and 2 cups flour  and even substitute white flour for the oats the more white flour you use  the lighter your bread will be  and you wont need quite as much yeast or vital wheat gluten
needing a way to use up a lot of 9 grain cereal that i had i decided to grind it up into fine flour and use it in slightly modified zaar recipe 71373 that i use for my white rolls.  we even like it slightly better with the cereal in it  i like to use my breadmaker to do some of the work but you could just as easily do it the traditional way.
water egg vegetable oil instant oats grain cereal white flour vital wheat gluten sugar salt active dry yeast
