mix all ingredients except grenadine in shaker and chill pour into martini glass add grenadine and it will sink to bottom
this is so good and so pretty  its bright blue and the grenadine makes a bright red layer at the bottom of the glass  be sure to serve it in a glass martini glass to get the great effect  i served this at our 4th party and received many raves. this is my first post  hope you like it.
