perfect for cookouts grilling potlucks and more there are others with the same name on the site but the ingredients are different in this one from pillsbury get togethers magazine. this one is fresh and light and can be a meal or a side dish. it is served cold so it can be made ahead and carted to wherever it needs to go. the pepperoni adds a punch of protein and color along with the red kidney beans. any medium pasta works but the farfalle makes a great presentation. enjoy chefdlh
