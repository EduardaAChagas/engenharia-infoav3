tender garlicky and full of oregano n stuff start this one a day ahead the beef slices need an overnight stay in da gravy to be at their best. and please dont overcook the roast as it rests right out of the oven and as its reheated itll stop mooing serve on crusty italian sandwich rolls add sauteed peppers if you like but too much more and it starts looking like a philly steak n cheese a whole other beast. prep time includes overnight marinating.
