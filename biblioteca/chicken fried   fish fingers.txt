i know fish is good for you but im one of those people that dont care for the fishy taste that some fish seem to have. my so convinced me to try different types of mild fish so i decided to try orange roughy and used my fried chicken recipe. this recipe is the great result. actual prep time is 2 hours 10 minutes 2 hours chill 10 minutes actual prep.  if you try this be careful turning as some of the coating might flake off but it still just as good.  submitted on april 25th2006
