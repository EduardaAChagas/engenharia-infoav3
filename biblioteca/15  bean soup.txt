i like bean soups since theyre cheap easy to make and healthy comfort food.  ive never made 15 bean soup before this but i loved the way this one turned out so i had to post it so i wouldnt forget.  it ended up being a combination of things i had around and wantedneeded to get rid of...either way this is yummy  i didnt add the meat off the bone but if you like it...feel free  great for cozying up when its cold or watching football or hockey.
