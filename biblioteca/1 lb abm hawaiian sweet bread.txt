add ingredients to your bread machine pan in the order listed above use light setting and regular bread this can be a highrising bread also notable is that i always look at my bread once the machine has warmed up and it begins its first blending  if its too dry  i add a little milk or juice  if its a little wet i add flour in teaspoons at a time  just eyeballing the consistency your entire house will fill with the aroma of this lovely sweet bread while it bakes 
hawaiian bread very similar to kings.  most recipes on food.comzaar are for 1.5 lb loaves  tried to reduce amounts with no success.  came up with this for the 1lb loaf and machine.  in all honesty i used allpurpose flour all i had in the house first time making this modified recipe  using tips from several sources and recipes. absolutely fabulous
