this is my original pasta sauce. its different than those that are simmered all day but its better than jarred sauce and its quick. you can also play around with the seasonings to suit your own taste. do not  please  cut the amount of olive oil. trust me on this. it sounds like a lot but its not really when you add all the pasta.
olive oil red pepper flakes fennel seed garlic cloves tomatoes dried basil dried marjoram dried oregano salt
