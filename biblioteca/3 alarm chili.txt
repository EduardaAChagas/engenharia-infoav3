i was in the mood for chili but i couldnt find a good recipe that i liked. so i took some ideas and created this.  of course you can use half a jalepeno or a chili or use no pepper for a mild chili but the jalepeno gives it a nice kick add more or less seasonings depending on taste 9 i cant really remember the exact measurements
