this came off the side of a goya can of beans to give credit where it is due and im thinking about subbing the crushed tomatoes with a 28oz can of pumpkin. putting it here for safekeeping. the topping listed came with the recipe but i prefer just to use some cheese to make chili cheese fries or nachos. i also would like to add extra salt and pepper because tomatoes have a natural sweetness and most vegetarian chilis are too sweet because the tomatoes and beans make up for the lack of beef.
