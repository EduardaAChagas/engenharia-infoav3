this chili tastes remarkably good and can be made for dinner when you are pressed for time. the recipe comes from the beefitswhatfordinner.com website but i originally saw the recipe in the newpaper. i have made this several times used whatever beef i had on hand. ive also added more beans and tomatoes to the same quantity of beef and it still tasted great.
