peel potatoes and cut into large chunks put potatoes in soup pot along with onion  celery  and chicken broth if there is not enough broth to cover the veggies  add a little water cover  bring to a boil  and let simmer for approximately 20 minutes  until vegetables soften if you like thicker soup  drain off some of the liquid if you like thinner soup  leave it as is and proceed use a potato masher to mash up the spuds mash more or less depending on how creamy or chunky you like your soup add white pepper  salt  and liquid smoke to taste add sour cream and velveeta  heat and stir until cheese melts dip the soup into 4 bowls top each bowl with shredded cheddar cheese  chives  and bacon bits eat and smile
