i figured that if i had to forgo my jeans to get all dressed up for a dinner party i was giving why should my salad get off easy the result is beautiful to look at and  impressed everyone plus they raved about my decadesold secret dressing.  quantities of the vegetable toppings are based on using one large head of iceberg lettuce and standard sized bowl but ive used iceberg and other salad greens in larger quantities by increasing amounts of vegetable toppings so top is not half dressed quantities of fresh veggies for rings are fairly approximate because salad bowls vary in sizes but rings should be uniformly shapeddont be afraid to try this  its not as complicated as it may seemre. secret dressing the recipe makes a good amount so can be enough for larger salads.  it really is a closelyguarded recipe given me by my cousin who was friends with a chef who swore her to secrecy. however i think since my promise of secrecy was made over 30 years ago the statute of limitations has run out he worked at one of the first very exclusive  spa resorts in southern california that still exists... the golden door.  at that time it was the first dressing i had ever had with fresh ginger and i had to drive miles to an asian market to find it and the rice vinegar... times have changed similar dressings now exist so im sure the spa now has a totally different secret dressing
