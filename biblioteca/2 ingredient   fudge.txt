make sure you have complimentary flavors melt the chips in a microwave safe bowl  stirring every 30 seconds until smooth melt frosting until pourable  about 30 seconds mix together the chips and frosting and pour into a greased 8x8 pan chill until set  about an hour makes a very soft  smooth fudge do not use the toffee chips  as they dont melt very well try any other flavor combo you can think of
