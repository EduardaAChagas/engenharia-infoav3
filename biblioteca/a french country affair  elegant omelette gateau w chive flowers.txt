take 2 bowls and add 5 eggs to each bowl  whisk lightly in a large frying pan  add 1 teaspoon of the olive oil and fry the courgettes  spring onions  chives and chive flowers saute for about 8 to 10 minutes over a low to medium heat until the vegetables and herbs are soft but not coloured set aside and season with salt and pepper in one bowl of whisked eggs  add the fried courgette mixture and in the other bowl of eggs  add the red peppers  garlic and chili  season well with salt and pepper in an 8 omelette or pancake pan  heat up some of the remaining olive oil and using a third of the courgette omelette mixture  make an open face omelette fry the omelette for about 5 minutes or until the omelette is firm carefully invert the omelette on to a plate  then slide it back in to the pan cooking the other side of the omelette for about 3 minutes or until firm make two more courgette omelettes this way and set them to one side to cool continue with the red pepper omelette mixture  making three more open face omelettes you will now have three courgette omelettes and three red pepper omelettes allow them to cool before assembling your gateau whilst the omelettes are cooling  make the filling mix all of the filling ingredients together  check the seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste take an 8 cake tine  line it with some cling film  making sure that it overlaps the sides to about 6 assemble the gateau  start of with the most attractive red pepper omelette  and place it in the cake tin  spread some filling over the top of the omelette continue with a courgette omelette and then a red pepper omelette  continue stacking the omelettes this way  spreading the filling in between them as you go you will end up with a big multilayered cake or sandwich of omelettes  take the excess cling film and cover the gateau to cover it completely allow to rest in the fridge for 24 hours when you are ready to serve it  carefully take the gateau out using the cling film to help you lift it out of the tin serve it on a pretty plate or cake stand  with the red pepper omelette facing the top sprinkle baby salad leaves and parmesan cheese shavings over the top and around the gateau chive flowers would also be an attractive garnish to serve  cut in to wedges and serve with the salad leaves and parmesan shavings  with extra salad leaves and dressing if you wish
this would be a wonderful centrepiece for a special celebratory meal such as a summer wedding christening anniversary birthday or a bridal shower. open faced omelettes studded with fresh vegetables and herbs including chives and chive flowers are sandwiched together with herb and garlic cream cheese to create a savoury vegetarian gateau  top the gateau off with parmesan cheese shavings and toss baby salad leaves on and around the gateau to serve. this does take a little time to prepare however it is made a day before it is needed making it ideal for a special event. you could add thinly sliced ham or crispy bacon if this is not required as a vegetarian dish. preparation time includes the chilling time overnight. the idea for this recipe was taken from a good food magazine  summer 2008.
