this is from ar bbq on elvis presley blvd. in downtown memphis tn. they say that the secret to bbq is the cut of meat the heat of the coals and the sauce. this is one of my very favorite sandwiches. its mouthwatering succulent ohsotender try it make sure to use a really good bbq sauce. have this with some crispy coleslaw and a great lager beer i love to put the coleslaw right on my sandwich servings will vary as the size of buns and the quantity of meat put on the buns.i will for the sake of notating call it 10 to 12 servings. that may be close. times will vary depending on the temperature of your coals.
