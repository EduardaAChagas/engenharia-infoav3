i remember when i was growing up watching my great aunt cook and listening to all her tips on cooking and was thinking about her fried cabbage.... so this morning new years day i decided to use up the cabbage i had left in the refrigerator. i added my own touch to my aunts way of steaming. she just usually steamed her cabbage in bacon grease i like to kick my food up just a notch  the measurements in this recipe might be off a bit but the main thing is getting the flavor of the spices.
