this recipe yields 3 hearty loaves of breadhere is what i love about this recipe. its simple uses few ingredients and you have great results every time. dont be afraid of making this breadthis is my own take on a recipe my sisterinlaw shared with me. i played around with using different ingredients and have found that for a heartier loaf perfect as a side to a homey soup you can add oats. also ground flaxseed makes a healthy addition of omega3 fatty acids as well as an extra dose of fiber. this bread is not too dense but comes out soft enough for sandwiches and freezes extremely well. it makes awesome toast for any toast lovers too
