mix all ingredients in a small bowl  while the kettle boils pour on 1  41  3 cup boiling water  give it a little stir  and cover with a plate for a few minutes to let the water be soaked up enjoy  or you could add other ingredients to power it up i bet pumpkin seeds and  or flaxseeds would be good its even sweet enough to serve as a dessert but hey  dont feel too guilty there are definitely much less healthy things you could be eating 
luckily for me this invention satisfied my desperate raisin craving when the only cookies we had in the house were chocolate chip
rolled oats dark brown sugar raisins salt
