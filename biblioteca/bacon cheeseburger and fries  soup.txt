my son asked for cheeseburger soup and having never made it i researched zaar. while i was browsing i had a vision the best baconcheeseburger and fries i ever had chopped into a soup or chowder. this is my vision realized. it came out even better than i had hoped. the flavors are layered no one thing stands out but each ingredient is recognizable. the celery stands in for lettuce and everthing else is present it is very rich.
