open up the sandwich rolls and scoop out most of the center in a small mixing bowl combine 2 tablespoons of pesto with the tepanade  artichoke slices and stir to mix well on the rolls spread 1  2 tablespoon of remaining pesto on each side of the rolls divide the olive artichoke pesto mixture between the two rolls and spread on each roll take slices of the turkey  ham and salami and cheese and place on top of the olive mixture  dividing them between the two sandwiches at this point you can make these hot or cold sandwiches for hot heat heavy cast iron skillet  place the two rolls and top with another pan or i use my tea kettle with water in it to squish them down heat through  turning over halfway for cold squish the two sides of the sandwich together and wrap tightly with suran wrap and place in fridge this gives the flavors time to marry  serve and enjoy
