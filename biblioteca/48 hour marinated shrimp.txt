i an lucky and have a shrimp connection....i get my shrimp right off the boat  i am always looking for an even better way to serve shrimp.  this is a refreshing recipe for a shrimp appetizer or a summer salad.  marinate for the full 48 hours for the best taste. great to use at a party because the shrimp are already peeled....no need to clean up all those shells
