alicia a member of raw pawsa yahoo pets groupposted this recipe citing the united states regional cook book by ruth berolzheimer as her source.wholesome sweeteners which is available in health food stores probably produces the only blackstrap molasses that actually tastes pretty good although the label might or might not state blackstrap they only produce one type you could also use barbados molasses for a less nutritious but bettertasting beverage. i use penzeys ground ginger and bragg vinegar because its unfiltered and contains the mother strandlike molecules of connected protein molecules as per the label.
