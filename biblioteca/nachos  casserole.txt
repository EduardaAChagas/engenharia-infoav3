for quite awhile there has been quite a debate about what to call this dish. i call it nachos my roommate calls it dip and my mom calls it nacho casserole. feel free to call it what you like but be prepared for it to not last long. this is the one dish that i am constantly asked to make. either to bring to a potluck or serve up at superbowl. its sooo tasty and really easy. plus because you eat it with tortilla chips as a dip kids love it. not to mention the fact that it is really versatile. the leftovers make great burrito fillers for a new meal the next night... if there are actually left overs. hope you enjoyif entertaining double or even triple the meat and all ingredients and bake in foil pans for quick clean up.note just to clarify this is meant to be eaten with tortilla chips as if a dip. no forks or spoons.. one of the reasons kids love it so much its fun and tasty.
