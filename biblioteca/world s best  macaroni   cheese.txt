we tasted this in seattle at the pike place market in the beechers store. it is the best i had to get their recipe and i found it on the internet it is a very rich creamy comfort food. i do not have beechers cheese so i improvised with what is available and it came out as tasty as the original. serve this with a crisp salad. enjoy
