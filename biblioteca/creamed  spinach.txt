i keep drained yogurt available in my fridge all the time i use a coffee filter and a wire strainer i usually drain it over night  but even a half hour makes a big difference once you drain the yogurt  it becomes very thick and much less tart cook spinach according to package directions while it cooks  saute chopped onions until slightly browned drain spinach well and combine with all other ingredients while still hot
i created this recipe one evening when i wanted something just a little bit special to serve my husband. its so simple yet tastes so very rich.
frozen spinach onion yogurt parmesan cheese
