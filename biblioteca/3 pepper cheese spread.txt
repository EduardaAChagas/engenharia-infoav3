mix all ingredients refridgerate at least 1 hour to allow flavors to marry serve with crackers and veggies 
an easy yummy spread to entertain with  you can adjust the amounts of peppers if you like  great with crackers and fresh veggies.  i also like this as a sandwich spread or on bagels.  cooking time includes refridgeration time...enjoy
