preheat oven to 425 mix the eggs  flour and milk in a blender on medium speed until just blended melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a 12inch castiron skillet pour the batter into the skillet over the melted butter place the skillet in the oven and bake until the top is puffy and golden brown  about 2025 minutes melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter when the dutch baby is done  spread the butter over it with a pastry brush then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar you can cut the dutch baby into equal servings  but in our family  we like to put the whole thing on a large plate and just tear pieces off 
this recipe is so named because the cinnamon sugar topping makes this pancake both look and taste a bit like an elephant ear from a carnival.  be sure to check it after 15 minutes of cooking and then every five minutes after that.  since some ovens run hotter than others ive found it can definitely change the cooking time required.
