in the search for the best pulled pork recipe there were several that i found that were appealing.  i combined a couple recipes and added my own flare to make this delicious dish.  the recipe is easy enough to include my kids.  my 3 year old really enjoyed asking the butcher for some pork butt while my 4 year old enjoyed applying the rub.
