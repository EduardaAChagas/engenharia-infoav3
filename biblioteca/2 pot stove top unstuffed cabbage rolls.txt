i love stuffed cabbage rolls but dont have the time or patience to stuff them.  i usually make a casserole version in the oven but after fooling around with a few recipes i had on hand i found this way much quicker and just as tasty.  makes a great busy weeknight dinner.  i like to serve this with some warm bread or dinner rolls.  i also like to make the rice with a recipe posted by jan s 53546 perfect rice every time we cook it
