a huge family favorite cheesy  garlicky  mushrooms and chicken yum yum o i made this up one day and have been touching it up over the years... i think weve got it sometimes i use the wild bunch prepackaged from our local store with baby bella shitake and oyster mushrooms. the mixture of mushrooms gives this an excellent flavor. but this recipe tastes good with any mushroom. if youre a big garlic fan you could add one extra clove after adding broth in step 5. please try id love to hear what you think this recipe does not include time for making crepes. i used the recipe from the crepe forum and they turned out fantastic
