put the butter  sugar  and syrup in a saucepan  and stir ir over a medium heat until the butter has melted put the melted mixture into a mixing bowl  and add the porridge oats and any optional ingredients you want to add put the mixture in a papered tin  flattening the mixture with the back of a spoon bake the flapjack in the oven at about 180c for around 30 minutes  or until the flapjack has browned once you take the flapjack out  you should cut it before it cools completely because it will harden if youre impatient  eat some warm but flapjack is just as delicious chilled if youre a chocaholic  i would recommend that when the flapjack has cooled completely  you melt a black of chocolate and pour it over  and wait for it to set
