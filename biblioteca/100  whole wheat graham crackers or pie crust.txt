i couldnt find the perfect 100 whole wheat graham recipe so i made one.  these are highly popular with kids and come together very quickly.  you can replace a little of the flour with milled flax wheat germ oat bran or whatever you like.  and you can make chocolate grahams by adding 13 cup cocoa.  crunch them up to make graham crumbs which are useful for a lot of things.  also this recipe makes an amazing pie crust.  please note  the instructions below are specific about rolling these out very thin and baking until crisp.  if you end up with anything but crisp crackers they werent rolled thin enough andor they werent baked long enough.
