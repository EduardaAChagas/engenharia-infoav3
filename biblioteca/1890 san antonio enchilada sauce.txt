this recipe is from cook em horns published by the university of texas exstudents association.  it is the only enchilada sauce recipe i use period.  homemade is always best. i have used a blender but i dont blend all the tomatoes.  i have also used a potato masher for the tomatoes for a thicker sauce.  cooking and prep time to not include preparing the enchiladas.  serve on beef chicken vegetarian...just about any kind of enchilada.
bacon grease onion garlic cloves whole tomatoes water salt pepper ancho chili chili powder sugar
