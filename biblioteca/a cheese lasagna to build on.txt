preheat the oven to 375 degrees f cook lasagna noodles as directed on the package drain  and let cool for a few minutes lay three noodles at the bottom of a ungreased lasagna pan add some pasta sauce  followed by some shredded cheese  followed by some cottage cheese sprinkle some garlic powder  salt and pepper with the exception of the vegetables repeat basic steps  until all the noodles  cheeses  sauce and seasonings have been used up on the first layer add the spinach on the second layer add the broccoli  and on the third layer add the red onion you dont have to go by this order  but it is a suggestion leave these vegetables if you are in the mood for just plain cheese lasagna  and just follow the first five steps bake for one hour
the title should speak for itself.  the reason why i call it so is because in my family everyone has different tastes and it is sometimes hard to appeal to everyone. i like to have broccoli and red onion my father will only likes spinach above all other vegetables and insists on packing on the cheese my mother prefers it plain and my brother doesnt like onion so much. the best combination of cheeses i found is monterey jack and cottage cheese.  all vegetables below are optional because the plain cheese lasagna is just the starting place.  for those who like to experiment go right ahead ill use any other ingredients you suggest as part of an optional ingredient list.
