mix together the cereal and first amount of water in a saucepan and cook for about 10 minutes to soften the cereal if you want you can set it aside to cool or mix together with cool water and ice cubes to cool it faster put all ingredients into a kitchenaid mixer mix together using the dough hook  once everything is mixed together knead for 2 minutes place dough in a greased bowl and let sit for 1 hour or until doubled in size i have also rushed this recipe and let it sit for as little as 15 minutes punch down and divide into 4 equal pieces i use a scale to ensure they are the same size shape dough and place into greased bread pans let rise for 1 hour or until double in size bake at 400 f for 15 minutes or until golden brown and the sound hollow when tapped on the bottom remove from pans and cool on wire racks
this is a recipe that i modified from a coworkers moms white bread recipe. it made such soft bread i wanted to see if i could use the base as a multigrain bread. prep time doesnt include rise time.
