in a bowl  combine all ingredients but the tomatoes cut each tomato into 45 slices so they are not thin spread each slice with 1 tbs of cheese mixture place on ungreased baking sheet and broil 3 inches from heat for 35 minutes or until cheese melts and is golden brown in color
a great appetizer that does not take much time at all to prepare.  these would be good on a slice of toasted bread too for an open face sandwich for lunch.
