a light but surprisingly rich onion soup. suitable for a simple lunch or dinner if served with a hearty bread sourdough is best and a salad and some milk or use it as the soup course for a big dinner and impress everyone. my dad calls it country style because he was served something very like it although he thinks made with chicken or beef stock while staying with friends in the french countryside. try to find butter with the ingredients sweet cream or cream salt but unsalted is better it will taste much better. use homemade veggie stock if possible or if you must canned but taste carefully before salting in that case  substitute chicken stock for more protein and a richer taste.
