drain chicken and put in bowl add some mayo so that it does not have that dry appearance next  start adding the apples  grapes  celery  and pecans next  chop up the egg and add it to the salad spread the salad on the bread with lettuce and tomato enjoy 
after enjoying an arbys sandwich i could not help but try to make one similar because it was that good. i think this is pretty close but better because all the fruits are fresh.  i dont really measure so the measurements are guesses and its more of getting a desired consistency.  also use your own favorite type of bread.  i preferably use whole grain wheat.
