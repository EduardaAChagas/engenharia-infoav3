pour water in a pot add sugar and allow it to come to boil till the mixture has one thread consistency remove from heat pour coconut milk powder into this mixture and mix thoroughly and quickly spoon out the mixture into a greased tray while the burfi mixture is still warm  cut it into pieces with a sharp knife otherwise  let it cool and then break into pieces the choice is yours i prefer to do it while it is still warm store in an airtight container for upto a week but i am sure it wont last that long because its quite yum and will be gone in the belly soon  enjoy
