made1 dozen teaspoon sized cookies 10 calories a cookie  375 for 10 minutes first open and rinse those noodles  i rinse them in the strainer with hot water be prepared  they dont smell good at all  i sprinkle them with a few teaspoons of lemon juice and let them sit a minute  then rinse again in hot water let them drain well water is our enemy in this recipe  next  get out a big frying pan you dont need any grease or anything the noodles dont tend to burn or brownand they dont stick dump the noodles in the pan and over high heat start cooking them i stirred mine around a lot as you stir and they start to dry  they start making a squeaking kind of noise as you push them i kept mine on the heat until they lost translucency and bits and parts seemed a bit shriveled take them off the heat i know  at this point it doesnt look like much does it  dont worry if you over cook  it will just mean 1 or 2 less cookies if you undercook it just means your cookie dough maybe a little runny  and you may need another teaspoon of coco powder to thicken it after they have cooled for a few minutes i put them in my handy mini ninja food processor i ran it until it almost looked like a gel then i threw in the honey  coco powder  baking powder  saltand processed it quickly till blended it seemed a hair on the runny side  so i threw it in the fridge for an hour and hoped for the best here is what it looked like after being in the fridge i covered a cookie sheet with a piece of tin and sprayed with pam non stick cooking spray i tried 5 minutes at 375 but the tops were clearly sticky  raw still so 10 minutes i was thrilled with what i had created  sara was my brave  brave guinea pig she topped hers with a touch of sugar free cool whip i watched her face carefully  mostly to know if i was going to need to duck if she spit it back out but she declared them a success  she said her first thought was it was a lot like the flourless chocolate torte in flavor 3 hours later i broke one a part and they are just as moist as can be truly a miracle cookie
