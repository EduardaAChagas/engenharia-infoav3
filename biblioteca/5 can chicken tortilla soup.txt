throw all ingredients into a pot  heat  and serve  sour cream  salsa  green onion  and hot sauce are also great toppings i was told canned chicken may be substituted for fresh chicken  although i have not tried it that way before you may use chicken boullion cubes and water instead of chicken broth
i got this recipe from my best friends family. this is the easiest chicken tortilla soup its not exactly traditional or authentic  but its delicioso
