soak the beans overnight  if possible the next day  drain and put fresh water in the pot bring the beans to a rolling boil make sure the beans are always covered by water  or they will discolor and get hard boil the beans for about 45  60 minutes  until the beans are tender but not falling apart drain while the beans are boiling  saut the trinity until the onions turn translucent add the garlic and saute for 2 more minutes  stirring occasionally after the beans are boiled and drained  add the sauted vegetables to the beans  then add the liquid smoke  smoked sausage  turkey sausage  seasonings  and just enough water to cover bring to a boil  then reduce heat to a low simmer cook uncovered for 2 hours at least  preferably 3  until the whole thing gets nice and creamy i taste the broth at around 1 5 hours and adjust seasonings as they cook down stir occasionally  making sure that it doesnt burn and  or stick to the bottom of the pot make sure the beans are reasonably fresh if its still not getting creamy  take 1 or 2 cups of beans out and mash them  then return them to the pot and stir if you can  let the beans cool  stick them in the fridge  and reheat and serve for dinner the next day theyll taste a lot better when you do this  youll need to add a little water to get them to the right consistency serve generous ladlesful over hot white longgrain rice  with good french bread i also have a bottle of hot sauce on the side for those who like it spicy 
this recipe comes from the gumbo pages and its the best basic recipe ive come across.  i tweaked it a bit to make it healthier by omitting the smoked meat and substituting liquid smoke and using the turkey sausage.  i have put the traditional notes on the ingredients as well.  it also has a very good vegetarian version i will post.  once you have the basics you can taste and tweak it to you and your familys tastes as the beans cook down.
