i love to make a big tray of these and keep them in the freezer for quick dinners or pull them out and take them to work for lunch they microwave great. i had hesitations about the cinnamon in this recipe but its fantastic i absolutely love the flavor  this recipe makes 18 pieces i normally eat 2 per meal.
