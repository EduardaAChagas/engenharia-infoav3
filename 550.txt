this is a very traditional dish from yemen and is made with oxtail  hence its name akwa this is the yemeni word for oxtail or literally the thickest part of the tail. it has one of the lengthiest cooking times ive encountered but really is worth the wait  you can get on with your chores whilst its cooking as it needs little attention. i have a feeling that this could also be tweaked a little to accommodate crock pot cooking  akwa is also commonly eaten during the month of ramadan.
