i make mine on one cookie rack placed on a baking sheet but im sure that the chicken could still be great placed directly on a foillined baking sheet although i dont think it would be as crispy. plan ahead the chicken needs to soak in the buttermilk for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight. if you like a lot of heat then use 2 tablespoons of hot pepper sauce or you can omit the hot pepper sauce completely but i suggest adding it in it really brings out the kick in this chicken you will love this recipe i know my family does
