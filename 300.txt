prepare a 13 x 9inch pan for the crust in a bowl combine the crust ingredients until well blended press gently into the bottom of the baking dish place one 20ounce bag of sandwich cookies in a food processor  then process until coarsely crushed remove a little less than half of the crumbs to sprinkle on top of cake in a bowl mix 1  2gallon of the softened ice cream with the coarsely crushed cookies fold in half of the container cool whip topping until combined transfer and spread over the cookie crust sprinkle the reserved crushed sandwich cookies over the top freeze for a minimum of 5 hours or until completely frozen if you are planning to freeze longer then this must be covered tightly with foil or it will pick up any freezer odors
just wait until you taste this it is so easy to make and so good the success of this cake will depend on the quality of ice cream that you use so try to purchase the best also try this using chocolate ice cream and mint oreo cookies  you can double this recipe but you will need a larger pan or make two pans plan ahead this needs time to freeze prep time includes freezing time.
