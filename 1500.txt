a unique and exotic dish for the acquired taste of lamb . not just any lamb only imported lamb from new zealand because of the type of food the lamb eats australian lamb will do as well. it has a kick so expect it. i dont recommend you using american lamb as the flavor is not the same . around easter most stores get imported lamb from nz  i buy all of my local stores imported nz lamb to make sure i have enough for the  year  as they only carry american the rest of the year. this is over 100 years old but i said that to be safe . it was given to me by grandfather whos mother and father was one of the first white familys  to move into south africa and they had new zealand lamb imported to them to their farm.
