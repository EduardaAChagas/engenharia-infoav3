place the first five ingredients in the bowl and mix add 2 cups 100 whole grain wheat flour mix then add 2 tbs of dry active yeast if your not sure about your yeast proof it in a little warm water first add 4 cups of 100 whole grain wheat flour mix until the consistency is some what even then continue to slowly add flour 1  2 cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl it should be tacky to the touch the trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy it will most likely be 6 1  2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1  2 cups of wheat flour you can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish dont over mix or the bread will be tough when your dough is finished  leave it in the mixer  cover the bowl and let it rise for about 3045 minutes the dough will be larger but it doesnt need to double grease two bread pans with crisco you can also flour the pans to reduce sticking mix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isnt sticky divide the ball in half and do it again shape the loaves by turning the dough under its self over and over when the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes if you forgot to preheat 41 minutes when done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool you can eat it right away dont wrap it until completely cooled put in tinfoil to store on the counter if you put it in the refrigerator it will turn into a brick enjoy
if you like fluffy brown bread this is it. no white flour here. you can use any 100 whole grain wheat flour. i mill my own. this bread is not heavy like most 100 whole wheat breads. if it is you used too much flour and your dough was too stiff. if it flattens out and wont stand up you need more flour. the total amount of flour is usually about 6 12 to 7 cups. this recipe has been in my family for years and we all make it. we make a lot more now that we have powerful mixers and the hand kneading is bye bye.
