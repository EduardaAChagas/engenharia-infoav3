this is the 100 percent whole wheat bread from the cookbook healthy bread in five minutes a day by jeff hertzberg and zoe francois. it makes enough for four 1pound loaves. if you are familiar with the book you know that the principle is to make a big batch of dough then grab off pieces each day or so to bake hot and fresh. they also say whole grain spelt can be substituted. in addition they offer more recipes photos videos etc. at www.healthybreadinfive.com. i would just like to mention that the cookbook is great for the wealth of background information and a huge variety of recipes. its great to read so even if you find the recipes you like online if  you have even a little interest in bread making you will enjoy the book immensely
