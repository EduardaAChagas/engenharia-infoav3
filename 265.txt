add ingredients in the above order in a 2 lb bread machine select whole grain setting
using 12 grain flour from bulk barn and a recipe that is a variation of the one they provide. bulk barn is a canadian food retailer specializing in bulk foods. the list of grains in the order on the label is hard whole wheat flour whole spelt flour kamul flour granola oats ground brown flax seeds quinoa seed amaranth seed barley flour whole rye flour dark buckwheat flour hulled sunflower seeds and millet seeds. if you have a 1 lb loaf bread machine reduce the yield below from 2.0 lbs to 1.5 lbs to get the right quantities for your machine. i use a black  decker bread machine with a 1 lb loaf pan. if you want a lighter bread reduce the 12grain flour by  cup and increase the white flour by  cup. if you want a sweeter tasting bread replace the brown sugar with honey. note i had to use whole wheat flour in the ingredients to get approximate nutrition values. note to those who live in the u.s.a. replace the white flour with bread flour.
