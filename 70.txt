this is our favorite meatloaf recipe.  i finally worked out one that i liked.  many years ago when our kids were growing up our son asked me one day why i was making meatloaf so often.  i told him that i was trying to find one that i liked.  he said he liked them all.  after i put this one together and we had it for dinner i thought right away this is the one  when i changed from ketchup to chili sauce it made all the difference.  this is a small meatloaf as we are seniors now and just the two of us left at home.  it would be easy to double the recipe if you need a larger meatloaf.  adjust the baking time however.
