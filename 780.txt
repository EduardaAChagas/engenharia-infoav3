yes another soup recipe  we really love a hot bowl of soup on a cold winter day for lunch.  the challenge is keeping it low fat and healthy.  this bean soup is fantastic  it makes alot and it freezes well.  you can really use any favorite bean mixture dry or use your own  i buy the 10 bean mix in bulk at a local grocery store.  it also has some pearl barley thrown in there too
