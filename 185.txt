this is a quick and easy version of the original recipe for cretons simply place the veal into a 2quart saucepan add all the ingredients at one time  plus one can of water as suggested on the soup can mix well and cook uncovered on the stovetop over a very low flame until all the liquid is absorbed and mixture is very thick in consistency approximately 3 hours cool slightly and pour into individual covered plastic containers and chill overnight this can be frozen for freshness and defrosted easily
as a native nyer relocated to french quebec the discovery of this morning morsel was very appealing though daunting because of the calories slathered on by the pork. this recipe is a lighter version of this traditional quebecquois breakfast meal and i think more tasty quick and easy to make. served on toast this savory pate is a meal in itself without the extra pounds.
