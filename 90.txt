this recipe is adapted from the el molino cookbook that ive had for a million yearsthis has the potential to make 3 loaves and is the only recipe i use for whole wheat bread.it is the moistest ive ever had and because honey is a natural preservative it has a longer shelf life. you can add a little more honey and make amazing dinner rolls or cinnamon rolls.the cookbook states the same natural ingredients but a new improved method that gives a higher lighter loaf. yes this rises 3 times i use the quick acting yeast and am able to make 9 loaves in a day without stressing out.you can substitute about a cup of the whole wheat flour with a cup of white bread flour but i rarely do.enjoy
