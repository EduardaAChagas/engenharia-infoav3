this recipe came with my kitchen aid mixer and makes two absolutely beautiful loaves of french bread. i misplaced my recipe book and recently found it again so am adding this recipe to zaar for safekeeping make sure you use a very very sharp knife to make the diagonal slashes. this bread is delicious on its own for sopping up stew or soup broth and with your favorite cheeses or toppings. prep time specified includes rising time.
