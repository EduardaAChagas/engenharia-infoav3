a classic frenchcanadian sweet. chômeur means unemployed therefore the dish bears its name because it is inexpensive. along with rice pudding and jello this is one of most commonly offered desserts in diners.  warning may cause sugar overdose.contrary to the usual recipe this one uses milk for a more cakelike texture. the original recipe also doesnt call for an egg but my mother always made it with the egg.
