this is a great recipe to start in the morning and have ready when you come home.  i love the packages with 16 kinds of beans...they make the best bean soup.  they dont come with a prepackaged mix or anything like it soundsthe 16 bean soup mix is just a package of 16 kinds of beans.  i didnt have turkey italian sausage so i used regular spicy italian sausage and i added a couple potatoes just because i love them.  recipe is posted as written.  serving size is estimated.  recipe courtesy of www.lovetoknow.com
